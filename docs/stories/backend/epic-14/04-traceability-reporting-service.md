Status: Draft

# Story
As a QA lead,
I want traceability reporting from acceptance criteria to automated tests,
so that coverage is visible and gaps are actionable.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. TraceLink model maps features/AC (from PRD/stories) to tests (by ID/path) and test results; supports Given‑When‑Then metadata.
2. Importer parses story files and PRD references to seed TraceLinks; manual curation via API allowed with audit.
3. Report API produces matrices by epic/story/feature showing coverage %, failing links, and orphaned tests; export CSV/PDF.
4. CI step publishes latest results to the report store; dashboard tiles available for coverage by module/epic.
5. Permissions enforced; links validated; stale links flagged; regression gates can check minimum coverage.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] TraceLink schema and importer from story/PRD docs (AC: 1, 2)
- [ ] Report API with matrices/exports (AC: 3)
- [ ] CI publisher and dashboard tile integration (AC: 4)
- [ ] Validation and permissions (AC: 5)

## Dev Notes
- PRD: testing strategy and acceptance coverage
- Architecture: testing-architecture.md; data-architecture.md
- ADRs: 0009 DB migration policy
- APIs: system.yaml (traceability)

## Testing
- Importer correctness on sample stories; matrix generation; CI publishing
