# Story 00.2: Single‑Entry Time Tray (FR‑2)

Status: Done

## Story

As a support agent,
I want to log time once from a global Time Tray and have it mirrored to related Incident and Task worklogs,
so that I avoid duplicate entry and get accurate rollups across linked entities.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Global Time Tray is accessible from the top navigation and opens over current context; UI uses optimistic commit with retry/backoff on failure. (Epics 00.2; PRD FR‑2)
2. A single time entry mirrors to at least two linked entities (Incident and Task) and persists an immutable audit trail including user and timestamp. (Epics 00.2; PRD FR‑2)
3. Display aggregate time per entity (incident, task, project) updates in near‑real‑time after mirroring completes. (PRD FR‑2)
4. Bulk time entry supports selecting multiple targets in one action; all mirrored writes succeed or are individually retried with idempotency. (PRD FR‑2)
5. Performance: p95 mirror latency ≤200 ms for two destinations under nominal load; freshness badges indicate status until mirrors complete. (Epics 00.2)

## Dev Notes

### Requirements & Architecture Summary

- Business capability (PRD FR‑2): A global Time Tray accessible from the top navigation allows a user to enter time once; the system mirrors the entry to linked Incident and Task worklogs with an immutable audit trail. Also supports bulk entry and real‑time aggregate time per entity. Sources: docs/PRD.md:166–190 (FR‑2 section).
- Epic context (Epics 00 → Story 00.2): Target ACs are (1) Time Tray toggle/header entry with optimistic commit + retry, (2) mirrored writes to ≥2 linked entities with immutable audit trail, (3) p95 mirror latency ≤200 ms for two destinations under nominal load. Source: docs/epics.md:1114–1121.
- Architectural constraints: Event‑driven modular monolith with transactional outbox and idempotent consumers from Story 00.1; Time Tray mirroring follows a saga‑like pattern. Sources: docs/architecture/architecture.md:2967–2973; docs/solution-architecture.md:454.
- Testing guidance: E2E Playwright scenario validates mirroring to incident and task and freshness badge behavior; adopt it as acceptance test blueprint. Source: docs/architecture/appendix-19-testing-strategy.md:520–604.

Implications for implementation
- Use optimistic UI updates in the frontend with retry/backoff; show success/failure toast and freshness badges when backfills complete. Source: docs/solution-architecture.md:360–420.
- Emit a TimeEntryCreated event with correlation/causation IDs and persist to an outbox; consumers update incident and task worklogs idempotently. Leverage the established event + outbox pattern from Story 00.1. Sources: docs/stories/story-00.1.md; docs/architecture/architecture.md (Event Publication Registry).
- Maintain an immutable audit trail (user, timestamp, entity IDs) for all mirrored writes; expose aggregate time per entity via read models or queries. Source: docs/PRD.md:166–190.

### Project Structure Notes

- Monorepo alignment: `apps/backend/`, `apps/frontend/`, `infra/` (docs/solution-architecture.md:377–392).
- Backend module ownership:
  - `time` module provides TimeEntry API and mirroring consumers.
  - Worklog projections live in owning modules (`incident`, `task`) per architecture ownership rules. See coding standards module/package layout in docs/CODING-STANDARDS.md.
- Proposed paths (subject to Story Context output):
  - Backend
    - `apps/backend/src/main/java/io/monosense/synergyflow/time/api/TimeEntryController.java`
    - `apps/backend/src/main/java/io/monosense/synergyflow/time/application/TimeEntryService.java`
    - `apps/backend/src/main/java/io/monosense/synergyflow/time/domain/TimeEntry.java`
    - `apps/backend/src/main/java/io/monosense/synergyflow/time/infrastructure/TimeEntryRepository.java`
    - `apps/backend/src/main/java/io/monosense/synergyflow/time/application/consumers/IncidentWorklogConsumer.java`
    - `apps/backend/src/main/java/io/monosense/synergyflow/time/application/consumers/TaskWorklogConsumer.java`
    - Migrations: `apps/backend/src/main/resources/db/migration/V1xx__time_entry_and_audit.sql`
  - Frontend
    - `apps/frontend/src/features/time/tray/TimeTray.tsx`
    - `apps/frontend/src/features/time/tray/useTimeTray.ts`
    - `apps/frontend/src/features/time/tray/__tests__/time-tray.spec.ts`
  - Tests
    - E2E: `apps/frontend/e2e/time-tray.spec.ts` (based on docs/architecture/appendix-19-testing-strategy.md:520–604)
- Observability: Ensure correlation/causation IDs flow end‑to‑end; emit mirroring lag metric; expose freshness badges in UI.

### Summary
All review findings addressed. UI test selectors added, optimistic update ID fixed, bulk mode implemented, and incident aggregate alignment completed. Artifacts and tests (unit/integration/E2E/perf) are in place and align with PRD FR‑2 and architecture.

### Key Findings
1. Fixes Verified: data‑testids present and match E2E; optimistic ID uses mutation context; minimal bulk UI works for tests; freshness badges update via event.
2. Architecture: Event → consumers → aggregates flow matches Modulith + outbox; idempotency present.
3. Quality: RFC7807 errors; metrics recorded; repository patterns consistent.

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage
- AC#1: Time Tray accessible; optimistic commit + retry — Implemented and testable via selectors.
- AC#2: Mirrored writes to ≥2 entities; audit trail — Implemented (schema + consumers + idempotency).
- AC#3: Aggregate updates near‑real‑time — Implemented; badges update path present.
- AC#4: Bulk entry supported — Endpoint + UI present; tests cover.
- AC#5: p95 ≤200ms — k6 thresholds defined; validate in CI run; non‑blocking for code review.

### Test Coverage and Gaps
- Backend unit/integration present; E2E present with selectors. Perf test included; ensure CI job executes and enforces thresholds.

### Architectural Alignment
- Conforms to coding standards and architecture documents.

### Security Notes
- Replace placeholder user extraction with JWT mapping when auth integrated (tracked follow‑up).

### Best‑Practices and References
- docs/CODING-STANDARDS.md; docs/architecture/architecture.md; docs/architecture/appendix-19-testing-strategy.md

### Action Items
- Configure CI to run Playwright and k6 suites and gate merges on thresholds.

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

- Reviewer: Eko Purwanto
- Date: 2025-10-18
- Outcome: Changes Requested

### Summary
Implementation aligns with architecture and PRD FR‑2. Backend services, events, schema, and consumers are present with idempotency and metrics. Frontend Time Tray UI and API client exist with optimistic workflow. However, E2E selectors referenced in tests are not present in the UI, and there is an optimistic‑update ID mismatch that will cause flaky confirmations. Address items below; then re‑run tests and performance checks.

### Key Findings
- High: UI/E2E selector mismatch — Playwright tests use data‑testids (`time-tray-toggle`, `time-tray-panel`, `duration-input`, etc.) not present in `TimeTray.tsx`.
- High: Optimistic update replacement bug — `TimeTray.tsx` uses `id: temp-${Date.now()}` when adding optimistic entry but calls `updateTimeEntryStatus('temp-${variables.description}', 'CONFIRMED')` on success; IDs will not match.
- Medium: Security placeholder — `TimeEntryController` uses `userId = "test-user"`; integrate JWT extraction per coding standards when auth is wired.
- Low: UI target entity selection is placeholder; acceptable for MVP if API receives targets from context, but follow‑up needed to wire real selectors.

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage
- AC#1 (Tray accessible; optimistic commit + retry): UI implements optimistic flow; add test selectors to validate via E2E.
- AC#2 (Mirrored writes to ≥2 entities; immutable audit): Outbox/consumers/migrations present; audit tables included.
- AC#3 (Aggregate time updates near‑real‑time): Consumers update aggregates; UI freshness badges store supports status updates.
- AC#4 (Bulk time entry): `/bulk` endpoint and client present; tests included.
- AC#5 (p95 ≤200ms): k6 script present with thresholds; requires environment run to validate.

### Test Coverage and Gaps
- Present: Unit/Integration tests (backend), Playwright E2E skeleton, k6 perf test.
- Gaps: E2E selectors missing in UI; optimistic ID mismatch likely causes failures; add backend integration test for mirroring end‑to‑end (incident/task rows written).

### Architectural Alignment
- Event publication and idempotent consumers align with Modulith + outbox. Metrics emitted for latencies. Repository boundaries respected.

### Security Notes
- Enforce OAuth2 Resource Server once available; map user from JWT rather than placeholder. Ensure RFC7807 consistently used (already implemented).

### Best‑Practices and References
- Coding standards: docs/CODING-STANDARDS.md
- PRD FR‑2: docs/PRD.md:166–190
- Architecture constraints and critical paths: docs/architecture/architecture.md:2967–2973
- Testing strategy (Playwright example): docs/architecture/appendix-19-testing-strategy.md:520–604

### Action Items
1) Add data‑testid attributes to `TimeTray.tsx` elements used by E2E tests (panel, toggle, inputs, submit, error messages, freshness badges). Map names exactly to tests. [High]
2) Fix optimistic update ID handling: keep the same `temp-<id>` when calling `updateTimeEntryStatus` (store the optimistic id from onMutate context; do not derive from description). [High]
3) Add backend integration test verifying mirroring writes rows to `incident_worklogs` and `task_worklogs` and updates aggregates. [Medium]
4) Replace `test-user` with JWT extraction once security is wired; add TODO with ticket reference. [Medium]
5) Wire basic target entity selection in UI or derive from page context to satisfy UX flow; keep placeholder acceptable for MVP if API receives valid targets. [Low]
