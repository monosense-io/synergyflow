# Story
As a CMDB steward,
I want a data quality dashboard UI,
so that I can track quality scores and remediate violations.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Dashboard shows quality scores by CIType/team with trend charts; filters by type/team/date range.
2. Violations table lists issues (missing owner, invalid attribute, relationship constraint); supports bulk assign/close with rationale.
3. Links to CI detail and remediation tasks; notifications can be triggered for owners.
4. Export CSV; permissions enforced; audit of actions.
5. Accessibility and performance: updates p95 < 1s with caching; a11y AA.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Widgets and filters; trend charts (AC: 1)
- [ ] Violations table with bulk actions (AC: 2)
- [ ] Remediation task linking and notifications (AC: 3)
- [ ] Export and permissions/audit (AC: 4)
- [ ] Caching and a11y/perf checks (AC: 5)
