# UX Design Principles

**1. "Quiet Brain" Experience - Minimize Cognitive Load**

Users should focus on work, not tool navigation. The interface anticipates needs, surfaces relevant information proactively, and reduces decision fatigue.

- **Implementation:** Unified "My Work" view aggregates incidents, tasks, approvals across both ITSM and PM modules
- **Implementation:** Smart notifications: only alert on urgent items (SLA breach imminent, approvals required)
- **Anti-pattern:** Avoid notification spam, tab clutter, redundant confirmation dialogs

**2. Trust Through Transparency - Make the Invisible Visible**

Build user trust by making system behavior transparent and explainable, especially for automation and eventual consistency.

- **Implementation:** Freshness badges show projection lag ("Data current as of 2.3 seconds ago")
- **Implementation:** Decision receipts explain every automated action ("Why was this auto-approved? â†’ Low-risk standard change, Policy v1.2.3")
- **Implementation:** Audit trails accessible for all critical actions (incident resolution, change approvals, policy evaluations)
- **Anti-pattern:** Avoid "black box" automation, hidden system state, unexplained failures

**3. Single-Entry Paradigm - Eliminate Duplicate Work**

Users should never enter the same data twice. The system intelligently mirrors and propagates information across modules.

- **Implementation:** Single-Entry Time Tray: log work once, mirrors to incidents and tasks automatically
- **Implementation:** Link-on-Action: "Create related change" pre-fills context from incident
- **Implementation:** Event-driven data propagation: incident status updates auto-sync to related tasks
- **Anti-pattern:** Avoid forcing users to copy-paste data, manually sync information, or maintain duplicate records

**4. Cross-Module Coherence - One Platform, One Mental Model**

The interface should feel like one cohesive platform, not separate ITSM and PM tools stitched together.

- **Implementation:** Unified navigation: single top bar with consistent menu structure across modules
- **Implementation:** Single search: "INC-001" or "STORY-42" finds entities regardless of module
- **Implementation:** Single notification center: all alerts (incident updates, task assignments, approvals) in one place
- **Implementation:** Consistent terminology: "Assigned to", "Status", "Priority" mean the same thing in ITSM and PM
- **Anti-pattern:** Avoid module-specific navigation paradigms, inconsistent terminology, disconnected search

**5. Progressive Disclosure - Simple by Default, Powerful When Needed**

The interface should be simple for common tasks, with advanced features accessible but not overwhelming.

- **Implementation:** Incident form: show only required fields (title, description, priority) by default, "Advanced" expander for optional fields
- **Implementation:** Policy Studio: visual editor for basic policies, code editor for advanced Rego expressions
- **Implementation:** Dashboard widgets: pre-configured templates for common metrics, custom widget builder for power users
- **Anti-pattern:** Avoid overwhelming forms with 50 fields, exposing internal complexity to end users

**6. Automation with Autonomy - Intelligent Defaults, User Control**

The system should automate intelligently while preserving user override capability for exceptions.

- **Implementation:** Auto-routing suggests optimal agent based on skills/capacity, user can manually override
- **Implementation:** Policy-driven auto-approval for low-risk changes, user can escalate to CAB for any change
- **Implementation:** SLA timers auto-escalate approaching breaches, user can snooze/reassign before auto-escalation
- **Anti-pattern:** Avoid rigid automation without override, forcing users into automated workflows they distrust

**7. Mobile-First Responsive - Work Anywhere, Any Device**

The interface should adapt gracefully to mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports without feature compromise.

- **Implementation:** Mobile web UI with responsive breakpoints (320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px)
- **Implementation:** Touch-friendly controls: 44px minimum tap target size, swipe gestures for common actions
- **Implementation:** Priority-based mobile layout: most critical information above fold (incident status, SLA timer)
- **Anti-pattern:** Avoid desktop-only features, requiring horizontal scrolling on mobile, tiny tap targets

**8. Accessibility First - Inclusive Design for All Users**

The interface should be fully accessible to users with disabilities, supporting keyboard, screen readers, and assistive technologies.

- **Implementation:** Full keyboard navigation: tab order follows visual hierarchy, Enter/Space trigger actions
- **Implementation:** ARIA labels for all interactive elements, semantic HTML (header, nav, main, article)
- **Implementation:** Color contrast: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- **Implementation:** Screen reader announcements for dynamic updates (incident assigned, SLA breach warning)
- **Anti-pattern:** Avoid mouse-only interactions, color-only information encoding, unlabeled form controls

**9. Contextual Help - Learn by Doing, Not Reading Manuals**

Users should discover features through contextual guidance, not external documentation.

- **Implementation:** Tooltips on hover/focus: brief explanation of feature, keyboard shortcuts
- **Implementation:** Guided tours for first-time users: interactive walkthroughs of key workflows
- **Implementation:** Empty state guidance: "No incidents yet. Create your first incident to get started."
- **Implementation:** In-app help center: contextual help articles based on current page
- **Anti-pattern:** Avoid cryptic error messages, requiring external documentation to understand features

**10. Feedback and Confirmation - Make Actions Predictable**

Users should always know the result of their actions immediately, with clear feedback for success, errors, and in-progress states.

- **Implementation:** Toast notifications for success: "Time logged to INC-1234, TASK-890" (3-second auto-dismiss)
- **Implementation:** Inline validation for forms: immediate feedback on invalid input (email format, required fields)
- **Implementation:** Loading states for async actions: "Saving..." with spinner, "Policy evaluating..." with progress
- **Implementation:** Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions: "Delete incident INC-1234? This cannot be undone."
- **Anti-pattern:** Avoid silent failures, ambiguous "saved" messages without context, long delays without feedback
