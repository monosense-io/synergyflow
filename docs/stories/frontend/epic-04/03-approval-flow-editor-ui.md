# Story
As an approval administrator,
I want a visual approval flow editor UI per service,
so that I can configure multi-stage approvals with clarity and control.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Visual editor to design approval stages (single/multi approver, delegation) and conditions; validates before save.
2. Associate/save flows per service; show current workflow version and history.
3. Test run feature to simulate approval path for given inputs; shows required approvers and outcomes.
4. Deploy/rollback controls with confirmation and rationale; audit all actions.
5. Accessibility and performance standards met.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Visual stage editor and condition builder (AC: 1)
- [ ] Save/associate to service with history (AC: 2)
- [ ] Test run simulator (AC: 3)
- [ ] Deploy/rollback UI and audit (AC: 4)
- [ ] a11y/perf checks (AC: 5)
