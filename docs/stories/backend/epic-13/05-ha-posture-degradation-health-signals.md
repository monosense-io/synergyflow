# Story
As a platform owner,
I want HA posture configuration with graceful degradation and health signals,
so that the system maintains core functionality during partial failures.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Configure HA posture per component (replicas, failover strategy, dependency criticality) with safe defaults per ADR 0003.
2. Implement degradation modes (read‑only, limited features, cache‑only) toggled automatically by health signals or manually via flags.
3. Health signal pipeline aggregates liveness/readiness, saturation, and dependency health; emits health.signal and degradation.entered/recovered events.
4. Degradation banner/indicators exposed via API for UIs; logs and traces mark degraded operations.
5. Posture validation tool checks for single points of failure and missing signals; outputs remediation actions.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] HA posture config schema and defaults (AC: 1)
- [ ] Degradation modes + feature flags + manual override endpoints (AC: 2)
- [ ] Health signal aggregator + events (AC: 3)
- [ ] Degradation indicator API + logging/tracing tags (AC: 4)
- [ ] Posture validation tool and report (AC: 5)

## Dev Notes
- PRD: HA posture and graceful degradation
- Architecture: gateway-envoy.md; observability-reliability.md
- ADRs: 0003 HA posture, 0011 cache store, 0006 event partitioning, 0010 Envoy Gateway
- APIs/Events: system.yaml (health/degradation), events (health.signal, degradation.*)

## Testing
- Degradation entry/exit triggers; feature flag overrides; health signal aggregation
- Posture validation on example configs; event contracts
