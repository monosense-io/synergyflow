# Story
As an ML engineer and product owner,
I want an ML monitoring dashboard,
so that I can track model performance, drift, and alerts.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Widgets: model versions with metrics (AUC/accuracy), data/label drift proxies, recent updates, and active alerts.
2. Filters by model/dataset/version/timeframe; drill‑down to run artifacts and training parameters.
3. Alert panel shows breaches with thresholds and actions (acknowledge, create ticket, trigger retrain) subject to permissions.
4. Export charts/data; RBAC enforced; audit of actions.
5. Accessibility and performance: refresh under 1s with caching; a11y AA.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Widgets and filters; drill‑down (AC: 1, 2)
- [ ] Alerts panel with actions and RBAC (AC: 3)
- [ ] Export and audit integration (AC: 4)
- [ ] Caching and a11y/perf checks (AC: 5)

## Dev Notes
- Backend: docs/stories/backend/epic-10/04-ml-pipeline-template-monitoring.md
- PRD: 2.12 ML monitoring
- Architecture/UX: docs/ux/README.md; gateway‑envoy.md
- ADRs: 0011 cache store; 0007 gateway
- APIs: system.yaml (models/metrics)

## Testing
- Metric accuracy rendering; alert flows; RBAC; export; a11y/perf
