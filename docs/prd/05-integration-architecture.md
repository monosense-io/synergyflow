## 5. Integration Architecture

### 5.1 External System Integration

**Integration Types**:

- **Authentication**: LDAP/Active Directory, SAML, OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect for federated identity
- **Security**: SIEM/SOAR integration for security operations and incident response
- **Monitoring**: Integration with system monitoring tools (Nagios, Zabbix, etc.)
- **Email**: SMTP integration for email notifications and ticket creation
- **Business Systems**: ERP, CRM, and business application integration
- **Asset Discovery**: Network scanning and inventory tools
- **API Gateway**: Centralized API management, rate limiting, and security
- **Message Broker**: Enterprise message queuing for reliable async processing

**API Standards**:

- RESTful APIs with OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- Webhook support for real-time updates
- Rate limiting: 600 requests/minute per client; 120 requests/minute per user
- Authentication via API keys or OAuth 2.0
- Response format: JSON with consistent error handling
- API versioning strategy with backward compatibility
- GraphQL endpoint for complex queries (real-time via WebSocket/SSE endpoints)
- API gateway with centralized security, monitoring, and throttling
  (Envoy Gateway, Kubernetes Gateway API)

### 5.2 Integration Patterns

**Adapter Pattern**: Standardized interface for different system types
**Event-Driven Architecture**: Spring Modulith events with `@ApplicationModuleListener` for decoupled module communication
**Domain Events**: `ApplicationEventPublisher` with transactional event publishing for aggregate state changes
**Event Publication Registry**: JDBC-based persistent event store (outbox) with automatic retry and completion tracking
**Workflow Orchestration**: Business process management engine triggered by domain events
**Message Queuing**: Reliable async processing with dead letter queues
**Circuit Breaker**: Resilience patterns for external system failures
**Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for transient failures
**API Gateway Pattern**: Centralized routing, security, and monitoring for all
external access (Envoy Gateway with Gateway/HTTPRoute)
**Outbox Pattern (JDBC)**: Transactional event persistence and externalization via JDBC event store
**Saga Pattern**: Long-running transaction management for complex business processes
