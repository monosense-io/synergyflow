Status: Draft

# Story
As a service designer,
I want a form schema editor UI with preview and validation,
so that I can define dynamic request forms with confidence.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Editor supports JSON Schema with helpers for conditional logic; inline validation with error highlighting.
2. Live preview renders the form with current schema and sample data; shows conditional behavior.
3. Versioning UI to compare schemas (diff) and restore previous versions with confirmation.
4. Save/publish workflow with RBAC and audit of changes (who/when/what).
5. Accessibility and performance: editor interactions responsive; large schemas handled smoothly.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Schema editor with linting and conditional helpers (AC: 1)
- [ ] Live form preview with sample data controls (AC: 2)
- [ ] Version history, diff, and restore (AC: 3)
- [ ] Save/publish flows with RBAC and audit (AC: 4)
- [ ] a11y/perf checks (AC: 5)
