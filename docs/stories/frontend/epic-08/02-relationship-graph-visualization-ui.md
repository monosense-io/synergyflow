Status: Draft

# Story
As a reliability engineer,
I want an interactive relationship graph visualization,
so that I can explore upstream/downstream dependencies and assess impact.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Graph view renders CIs as nodes and relationships as edges with types/colors; supports pan/zoom, expand/collapse, and search.
2. Filters by type, environment, status, and depth; highlight path between two nodes; show edge details (latency/capacity) on hover.
3. Click a node to see details drawer (owner, status, attributes) and quick actions.
4. Performance: render 1k nodes/2k edges with virtualization; interactions remain responsive.
5. Accessibility and responsive layout; keyboard navigation for nodes.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Graph rendering with virtualization and interaction controls (AC: 1, 4)
- [ ] Filters/depth controls and path highlight (AC: 2)
- [ ] Node details drawer and quick actions (AC: 3)
- [ ] a11y/responsive checks; keyboard navigation (AC: 5)
