# Epic 15 — Integration Architecture & API Gateway

## Epic Goal
Provide a secure, scalable integration layer and API gateway for internal/external consumers (PRD 5).

## Scope
- In scope: API gateway policies, OpenAPI governance, module APIs, webhooks/events, partner integration patterns, rate-limiting and auth.
- Out of scope: Analytics pipelines (Epic 10).

## Key Requirements
- PRD 5: Integration architecture and standards; reliable, versioned APIs; webhook/event interfaces; gateway mediation.

Refs: docs/prd/05-integration-architecture.md

## Architecture & ADR References
- Gateway: docs/architecture/gateway-envoy.md, docs/adrs/0007-api-gateway-placement-scope.md, docs/adrs/0010-envoy-gateway-adoption-k8s-gateway-api.md
- API architecture: docs/architecture/api-architecture.md
- Event contract versioning: docs/adrs/0004-event-contract-versioning.md

## API & Events Impact
- APIs: docs/api/openapi.yaml and module APIs in docs/api/modules/*.yaml
- Events: publisher/subscriber conventions as per docs/api/modules/events.yaml

## Data Model Impact
- Entities: ApiClient, ApiKey, RateLimitPolicy, WebhookSubscription, EventContract.
- Refs: docs/prd/18-data-model-overview.md

## Dependencies
- Epic 12 (Security) for authz; Epic 11 (Notifications) for webhook retries; domain epics for API exposure.

## Risks & Mitigation
- Breaking changes → versioning strategy, deprecation policy, contract tests.
- Abuse → rate limits, WAF, anomaly detection.

## Acceptance Criteria (Epic)
- Gateway operational with policies; OpenAPI validated; webhooks/events documented and reliable; partner integrations certified.

## Story Seeds
1) Gateway deployment and policy configuration.
2) OpenAPI governance tooling and CI checks.
3) Webhook subscription service with retries and signing.
4) Event publishing standards and SDKs.

## Verification & Done
- Conformance tests; partner sandbox validation; reliability KPIs.
