Status: Draft

# Story
As a QA engineer,
I want a flaky tests dashboard UI,
so that I can identify, prioritize, and track flaky tests for remediation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Dashboard aggregates test instability metrics (fail→pass, pass→fail, retries) and ranks by flakiness score; filters by module/suite/timeframe.
2. Detail view shows trend over time, related issues, quarantine status, and links to recent runs.
3. Actions: mark as quarantined/unquarantined with rationale (authorized roles); create remediation tickets.
4. Export CSV; a11y AA; performance responsive.
5. Integrates with CI to update statuses in near real‑time.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Flaky ranking and filters; list UI (AC: 1)
- [ ] Detail trends and links; quarantine status (AC: 2)
- [ ] Actions and ticket creation (AC: 3)
- [ ] Export and a11y/perf (AC: 4)
- [ ] CI integration for near real‑time updates (AC: 5)
