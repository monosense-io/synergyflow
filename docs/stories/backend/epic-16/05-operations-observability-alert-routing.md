Status: Draft

# Story
As a platform SRE,
I want operations observability dashboards and alert routing integration,
so that signals drive deployments, rollouts, and incident response effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Expose system metrics endpoints and alert routes (owners, channels, quiet hours) per service; integrate with Notifications.
2. Standard dashboards for deployments, rollouts, migrations, and incidents; tiles feed Epic 09; p95 freshness < 60s.
3. Alerts for deploy failures, migration anomalies, and canary KPIs with dedupe/grouping (Epic 11); runbook links embedded.
4. health.signal events generated from aggregated probes; degradation banners available via API for UIs.
5. Documentation for SLO‑first instrumentation and alert tuning; audit of alert changes.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Metrics endpoints and standard dashboards (AC: 2)
- [ ] Alert route model and Notifications integration (AC: 1, 3)
- [ ] health.signal emitter and degradation API (AC: 4)
- [ ] Docs for instrumentation and alert tuning; audit changes (AC: 5)

## Dev Notes
- PRD: docs/prd/20-deployment-operations.md; link to Epic 13 SLOs
- Architecture/ADRs: observability-reliability.md; 0006 partitioning; 0011 cache
- APIs/Events: system.yaml (metrics/alerts), events (health.signal)

## Testing
- Dashboard data correctness/freshness; alert routing behavior; health signals; audit changes
