## 13. Security & Compliance Framework

### 13.1 Authentication & Authorization

**Authentication Methods**:

- Primary: LDAP/Active Directory integration
- Fallback: Local user accounts with strong password policies
- API access: JWT tokens with configurable expiration
- Multi-factor authentication for administrative accounts

**Authorization Model**:

- Role-based access control (RBAC) with hierarchical permissions
- Team-based data isolation
- Field-level security for sensitive information
- Audit trails for all access and modifications
- Privileged Access Management (PAM) for administrative operations
- Zero-trust architecture with continuous verification
- Just-in-time access for sensitive operations

### 13.2 Data Protection

**Encryption**:

- Data at rest: Storage-level encryption (e.g., LUKS/cloud provider) + application/pgcrypto column encryption for sensitive fields
- Data in transit: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- File storage: MinIO server-side encryption
- Password hashing: bcrypt with configurable work factor
- Event payload encryption: Sensitive data encrypted before serialization in event store

**Module Security Boundaries**:

- Cross-module access control enforced at Spring Modulith boundaries with `@ApplicationModule(allowedDependencies)`
- Event payload sanitization to prevent sensitive data leakage across module boundaries
- Named interface security with `@NamedInterface` annotations for controlled API access
- Module-level audit logging for compliance tracking and boundary violation detection
- **Event Security Patterns**:

  ```java
  // Secure event payload design
  @Externalized("itsm.incident.created::#{#this.getTeamId()}")
  public record IncidentCreatedEvent(
      String incidentId,
      @Sensitive String teamId, // Custom annotation for PII
      String severity,
      String affectedServiceId,
      Instant createdAt,
      String version
  ) {
      // Sanitize sensitive data for cross-module events
      public IncidentCreatedEvent sanitized() {
          return new IncidentCreatedEvent(incidentId, "***", severity, 
                                        affectedServiceId, createdAt, version);
      }
  }
  ```

- **Module API Security**:

  ```java
  @NamedInterface("api")
  @Secured("ROLE_TEAM_ADMIN")
  package io.monosense.synergyflow.team.api;
  
  @PreAuthorize("hasRole('TEAM_ADMIN') or @teamSecurityService.canAccessTeam(#teamId, authentication.name)")
  public TeamInfo getTeamInfo(String teamId);
  ```

**Compliance Requirements**:

- Data retention policies with automated cleanup
- Right to deletion for user data (GDPR compliance)
- Audit logging with tamper-proof storage
- Backup encryption and secure storage
- Access logging for compliance reporting
- Data classification schema (Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted)
- SOX compliance controls for financial change approvals
- ISO 27001 information security management alignment
- Regulatory reporting automation (GDPR, SOX, industry-specific)

### 13.3 Security Monitoring

**Security Controls**:

- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- XSS protection with content security policy
- CSRF protection for state-changing operations
- Rate limiting: 120 requests/minute per user

**Monitoring & Alerting**:

- Failed authentication attempt monitoring
- Unusual access pattern detection
- Privilege escalation alerts
- Data export monitoring
- System health and availability monitoring
- Security incident response integration with SIEM/SOAR
- Threat detection and automated response
- Security analytics and behavioral analysis
- Vulnerability scanning and management
- Security compliance monitoring and reporting
- **Event Security Monitoring**: Unauthorized event access, payload tampering detection
- **Module Boundary Violations**: Architectural compliance monitoring with /actuator/modulith endpoint
- **Cross-Module Data Flow**: Audit trails for inter-module communications via event publication registry

### 13.4 Secret Management

**Objective**: Secure storage and management of application secrets and credentials

**Requirements**:

- Integration with enterprise-grade secret stores (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault)
- Automatic secret rotation with zero-downtime application updates
- Least-privilege access patterns with service-specific secret scoping
- Development environment secret management with production isolation
- Audit logging for all secret access and rotation events

**Secret Categories**:

- Database credentials with automatic rotation support
- External API keys and tokens for third-party integrations
- Encryption keys for data protection and event payload security
- LDAP/AD service account credentials
- Email and notification service authentication tokens

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Zero hardcoded secrets in application configuration or code
- Automatic secret retrieval during application startup
- Secret rotation without application restart or downtime
- Role-based access control for secret management operations
- Complete audit trail for secret access and lifecycle events
- Development environment uses separate secret scope from production

**Spring Modulith Integration**:

```java
@Configuration
@ConditionalOnProperty("app.secrets.vault.enabled")
public class SecretManagementConfig {
    
    @Bean
    @ConfigurationProperties("app.secrets")
    VaultTemplate vaultTemplate(VaultOperations operations) {
        // Secure secret retrieval for module configurations
        return new VaultTemplate(operations);
    }
    
    @EventListener
    public void onSecretRotation(SecretRotatedEvent event) {
        // Notify modules of credential updates via events
        eventPublisher.publishEvent(new ConfigurationUpdatedEvent(
            event.getSecretPath(), event.getRotationTimestamp()
        ));
    }
}
```

- **Spring Modulith Security Integration**:

  ```java
  @Component
  public class ModuleBoundarySecurityMonitor {
      
      @EventListener
      public void onModuleBoundaryViolation(ArchitecturalViolationEvent event) {
          securityLogger.warn("Module boundary violation detected: {}", event.getViolation());
          alertService.sendSecurityAlert(event);
      }
      
      @Scheduled(fixedRate = 300000) // Every 5 minutes
      public void validateModuleBoundaries() {
          try {
              ApplicationModules.of(SynergyFlowApplication.class).verify();
          } catch (Violations violations) {
              securityLogger.error("Critical module boundary violations: {}", violations);
              alertService.sendCriticalSecurityAlert(violations);
          }
      }
  }
  ```
