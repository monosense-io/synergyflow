Status: Draft

# Story
As a platform engineer,
I want secrets management integration for application configuration,
so that sensitive values are stored, rotated, and accessed securely.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. SecretRef model references external secret manager paths/keys (e.g., vault://, aws‑sm://); no plaintext secrets in config or DB.
2. Secret retrieval library with caching, TTLs, and automatic rotation hooks; supports per‑service identities and least privilege.
3. Configuration endpoints accept SecretRef values and validate accessibility; secrets never returned in responses; masked in logs.
4. Rotation workflows: trigger rotation, notify dependents, and verify rollout; audit all accesses/rotations.
5. Policy checks ensure encryption in transit/at rest; misconfigurations flagged; startup fails closed when required secrets missing.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] SecretRef model and validation (AC: 1)
- [ ] Retrieval library with cache/TTL and identity support (AC: 2)
- [ ] Config endpoints with SecretRef acceptance and masking (AC: 3)
- [ ] Rotation workflows and notifications (AC: 4)
- [ ] Policy checks and fail‑closed startup (AC: 5)

## Dev Notes
- PRD: docs/prd/13-security-compliance-framework.md (encryption, secrets management)
- Architecture: security-architecture.md; gateway‑envoy.md egress rules
- ADRs: 0009 DB migrations (SecretRef schemas); 0001 event bus (rotation events)
- APIs: system.yaml (secrets configuration references)

## Testing
- SecretRef validation; retrieval/rotation flows; masking and access control
- Fail‑closed behavior; audit logs; notification hooks
