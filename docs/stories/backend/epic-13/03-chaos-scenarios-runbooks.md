# Story
As a reliability lead,
I want defined chaos scenarios with automated drills and runbooks,
so that we can validate resiliency patterns and operational readiness.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Catalog of chaos scenarios (dependency failure, latency spikes, partial outages, cache eviction storms) with safe blast‑radius controls.
2. Drill runner triggers scenarios in non‑prod and controlled prod windows; evidence collection (metrics, logs, traces) attached to drill records.
3. Runbooks for each scenario with clear steps, roles, and rollback; tracked in a repository and linked to drills.
4. Pass/fail criteria and SLO impact measured; results published to ReliabilityReview records; notifications sent.
5. Audit all drills (who, when, scope); guardrails prevent accidental broad impact; approvals required for prod.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Scenario catalog schema and storage (AC: 1)
- [ ] Drill runner with guards and evidence collection (AC: 2)
- [ ] Runbook linkage and repository integration (AC: 3)
- [ ] Pass/fail evaluation and ReliabilityReview creation (AC: 4)
- [ ] Approvals workflow and audit (AC: 5)

## Dev Notes
- PRD: HA/reliability architecture & requirements (chaos drills)
- Architecture: observability-reliability.md; deployment-architecture.md (safe windows)
- ADRs: 0006 partitioning (simulate event load); 0011 cache (eviction scenarios)
- APIs: system.yaml (drills/reviews)

## Testing
- Dry‑run simulations; evidence attachments; pass/fail evaluations
- Approval gates; audit integrity; notification hooks
