Status: Draft

# Story
As an SRE and product owner,
I want a reliability dashboard showing SLOs, error budgets, and burn rates,
so that I can track reliability posture and act early.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Widgets: SLO status per service, error budget remaining, burn rate (multi‑window), and breach predictions; filters by service/env/timeframe.
2. Drill‑down shows SLI details and recent incidents impacting SLO; links to dashboards from Epic 09.
3. Alerts surface active slo.breach and health signals; acknowledge/assign actions for authorized roles.
4. Export CSV/PNG; permissions enforced; a11y AA; performance: refresh under 1s with caching.
5. Real‑time updates via SSE/WebSocket; polling fallback.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Widgets and filters; drill‑down (AC: 1, 2)
- [ ] Alerts panel and actions (AC: 3)
- [ ] Export + permissions + a11y/perf (AC: 4)
- [ ] Real‑time updates/polling (AC: 5)

## Dev Notes
- Backend: docs/stories/backend/epic-13/01-slo-definitions-monitoring.md
- PRD: 9/12 reliability requirements
- Architecture/UX: docs/ux/README.md; gateway‑envoy.md; observability-reliability.md
- ADRs: 0011 cache; 0007 gateway
- APIs: system.yaml (SLO), events (slo.breach, health.signal)

## Testing
- Widget accuracy; real‑time updates; export; a11y/perf
