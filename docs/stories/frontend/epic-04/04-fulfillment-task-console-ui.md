Status: Draft

# Story
As a fulfillment coordinator,
I want a task console UI to manage fulfillment tasks,
so that requests are executed efficiently with clear ownership and audit.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Task list with filters (status, assignee, service, date) and pagination; bulk actions (assign, reassign) for authorized users.
2. Task detail shows steps, attachments, notes, and audit timeline; actions to start/complete/block with rationale.
3. Notifications/overdue indicators; SLA badges on tasks.
4. Accessibility and responsive layout; performance: list p95 < 800ms.
5. Real-time updates for task state changes; fallback polling with backoff.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task list with filters/pagination and bulk actions (AC: 1)
- [ ] Task detail actions and audit timeline (AC: 2)
- [ ] SLA badges and overdue indicators (AC: 3)
- [ ] Real-time updates/polling; a11y/responsive checks (AC: 4, 5)
