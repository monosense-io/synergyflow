2. Copy JSON from [Linear API Payload (JSON)](#linear-api-payload-json)
3. Run script with `curl` or Postman
4. All issues created in seconds ‚úÖ

### **Manual Path (30 minutes):**
Use swimlane cards + Lane-compatible templates to create issues one-by-one in Linear UI

---

## Method 1: CSV Import (Easiest)

### Step 1: Prepare CSV File

Copy the CSV from section [CSV Export Format](#csv-export-format-ready-to-use) and save as `synergyflow-sprints.csv`

### Step 2: Access Linear Import

```
1. Go to Linear workspace
2. Click Settings (‚öôÔ∏è) ‚Üí Integrations ‚Üí Import
   OR
   Go directly to: https://linear.app/[workspace]/settings/integrations/import
3. Click "Import" ‚Üí Select "CSV"
```

### Step 3: Upload & Map

```
1. Click "Choose File" ‚Üí Select synergyflow-sprints.csv
2. Linear auto-detects columns; verify mapping:
   ‚úÖ Title ‚Üí Title
   ‚úÖ Description ‚Üí Description
   ‚úÖ Status ‚Üí Status (Backlog, Todo, In Progress, Done)
   ‚úÖ Priority ‚Üí Priority (0=No priority, 1=Urgent, 2=High, 3=Medium, 4=Low)
   ‚úÖ Assignee ‚Üí Assignee
   ‚úÖ Estimate ‚Üí Estimate (story points)
   ‚úÖ Team ‚Üí Team (backend, frontend, devops, qa)
   ‚úÖ Cycle ‚Üí Cycle (Sprint 01, Sprint 02, etc.)
   ‚úÖ Labels ‚Üí Labels (comma-separated tags)
3. Click "Next"
```

### Step 4: Review & Import

```
1. Preview shows number of issues to import (should be 120+)
2. Click "Import" ‚Üí Linear processes CSV
3. Wait for completion (may take 1-5 minutes for large backlog)
4. ‚úÖ All issues created!
```

### Step 5: Verify Import

```
After import completes:
1. Go to Issues view
2. Filter by Team or Cycle
3. Verify story counts:
   ‚Ä¢ Total stories: ~120
   ‚Ä¢ Phase 1 (Sprints 01-04): 12 stories
   ‚Ä¢ Phase 2 (Sprints 05-12): 48 stories
   ‚Ä¢ Phase 3 (Sprints 13-22): 50 stories
   ‚Ä¢ Phase 4 (Sprints 23-24): 10 stories
```

---

## Method 2: Linear API (Fastest for Bulk)

### Step 1: Get Linear API Key

```
1. Go to Linear workspace ‚Üí Settings (‚öôÔ∏è)
2. Click "API" or "Personal API Keys"
3. Click "Create new" API key
4. Copy the key (starts with "lin_")
5. Keep it secure (don't commit to git)
```

### Step 2: Prepare API Script

Create file `linear-import.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

API_KEY="lin_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
WORKSPACE_ID="YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID_HERE"
TEAM_ID="YOUR_TEAM_ID_HERE"

# Function to create issue
create_issue() {
    local title=$1
    local description=$2
    local priority=$3
    local estimate=$4
    local labels=$5

    curl -X POST "https://api.linear.app/graphql" \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d "{
            \"query\": \"mutation { issueCreate(input: { teamId: \\\"$TEAM_ID\\\", title: \\\"$title\\\", description: \\\"$description\\\", priority: $priority, estimate: $estimate, labelIds: [$labels] }) { issue { id title } } }\"
        }"
}

# Example: Create Sprint 01 stories
create_issue \
    "Sprint 01: Platform Foundation Kickoff" \
    "Phase 1: Weeks 1-2 | Epic-16 Platform Foundation" \
    2 \
    "0" \
    ""

echo "‚úÖ Issue creation initiated"
```

### Step 3: Run Script

```bash
export API_KEY="lin_YOUR_API_KEY"
export WORKSPACE_ID="your-workspace-id"
export TEAM_ID="your-team-id"

bash linear-import.sh
```

### Step 4: Verify in Linear UI

```
Issues created automatically in Linear
‚úÖ Appears in Issues ‚Üí All Issues view
‚úÖ Organized by Team (if team_id mapped correctly)
```

---

## Method 3: Manual Import via UI

### Batch Create via Linear UI

```
1. Go to Linear workspace ‚Üí Issues
2. Click "+" ‚Üí "New issue"
3. Fill in:
   ‚Ä¢ Title: [Story ID] [Title]
   ‚Ä¢ Description: [Acceptance criteria]
   ‚Ä¢ Team: [Backend/Frontend/DevOps/QA]
   ‚Ä¢ Cycle: [Sprint NN]
   ‚Ä¢ Priority: [0-3]
   ‚Ä¢ Estimate: [5/8/13/21]
   ‚Ä¢ Assignee: [Team member]
4. Click "Create" ‚Üí Repeat for each story
```

**Time estimate:** ~30 seconds per story √ó 120 stories = ~60 minutes

**Tip:** Use keyboard shortcut `Cmd+K` then `+` to quickly create new issues

## Linear API Payload (JSON)

### GraphQL Mutation for Bulk Create

If using Linear API directly (advanced):

```graphql
mutation CreateIssues {
  issueCreate(input: {
    teamId: "YOUR_TEAM_ID",
    title: "Sprint 01: Platform Foundation Kickoff",
    description: "Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2) | Epic-16: Platform Foundation | Goals: Modulith baseline, DB, CI/CD skeleton",
    priority: 1,
    estimate: 0,
    labelIds: ["PHASE-1", "PLATFORM"]
  }) {
    issue {
      id
      title
      identifier
    }
  }
}
```

### JavaScript Bulk Create Script

Save as `linear-bulk-import.js`:

```javascript
const LINEAR_API_KEY = "lin_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";
const TEAM_ID = "YOUR_TEAM_ID_HERE";

const stories = [
  {
    title: "16.05: Spring Modulith Configuration",
    description: "Modulith config with event registry...",
    priority: 1,
    estimate: 13,
    labels: ["epic-16", "critical-path"]
  },
  {
    title: "16.10: PostgreSQL + PgBouncer Setup",
    description: "Database cluster with connection pooling...",
    priority: 1,
    estimate: 13,
    labels: ["epic-16", "critical-path"]
  },
  // ... add more stories
];

async function createIssue(story) {
  const query = `
    mutation {
      issueCreate(input: {
        teamId: "${TEAM_ID}",
        title: "${story.title.replace(/"/g, '\\"')}",
        description: "${story.description.replace(/"/g, '\\"')}",
        priority: ${story.priority},
        estimate: ${story.estimate},
        labelIds: ${JSON.stringify(story.labels)}
      }) {
        issue {
          id
          identifier
          title
        }
      }
    }
  `;

  const response = await fetch("https://api.linear.app/graphql", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Authorization": `Bearer ${LINEAR_API_KEY}`,
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ query }),
  });

  const result = await response.json();
  return result.data.issueCreate.issue;
}

async function bulkImport() {
  console.log("Starting bulk import...");
  for (const story of stories) {
    const issue = await createIssue(story);
    console.log(`‚úÖ Created: ${issue.identifier} - ${issue.title}`);
  }
  console.log("‚úÖ All stories imported!");
}

bulkImport().catch(console.error);
```

### Run Script

```bash
node linear-bulk-import.js
```

## Troubleshooting

### Q: CSV Import Says "No Columns Match"

**A:** Column names must be exact. Verify header row:
```
‚úÖ Correct: Title, Description, Status, Priority
‚ùå Wrong: title, description, status, priority (case-sensitive)
```

### Q: Issues Created But No Team Assignment

**A:** Team column must match exact team name in Linear. Check:
```
Go to Linear Settings ‚Üí Teams ‚Üí Copy exact team name
Use in CSV Team column: "Backend" vs "backend" vs "Engineering/Backend"
```

### Q: API Key Invalid Error

**A:** Regenerate API key:
```
1. Go to Linear Settings ‚Üí API or Personal API Keys
2. Delete old key (if needed)
3. Create new key
4. Copy full key (starts with "lin_")
5. Test: curl -H "Authorization: Bearer lin_YOUR_KEY" https://api.linear.app/graphql
```

### Q: Assignee Not Set on Import

**A:** Assignee must be exact email or username. Verify in Linear:
```
Settings ‚Üí Workspace Members
Copy exact email/username from list
Use in CSV: @backend-1 must match actual username
```

### Q: Import Takes Too Long

**A:** Linear processes in batches. For 120+ stories, may take 5-10 minutes. Do not refresh page. Check import status in Settings ‚Üí Import History.

### Q: Cycle (Sprint) Not Assigned

**A:** Cycles must exist before import. Create cycles first:
```
1. Go to Linear ‚Üí Cycles (left sidebar)
2. Click "Create cycle" ‚Üí Create Sprint 01, Sprint 02, etc.
3. Then import CSV (Cycle column will match)
```

### Q: Duplicate Issues Created

**A:** Linear prevents duplicates by ID. If import fails midway and retries, may create duplicates. Solution:
```
1. Go to Issues
2. Search for duplicates
3. Delete extras manually
4. Re-run import (will skip existing by ID)
```

---

## Post-Import Checklist

After importing to Linear:

- [ ] **Verify counts:** 120+ issues created in correct cycles
- [ ] **Check teams:** All issues assigned to correct team (Backend/Frontend/DevOps/QA)
- [ ] **Verify priorities:** Critical path stories marked Priority 1 (Urgent)
- [ ] **Confirm estimates:** All stories have story points (5/8/13/21)
- [ ] **Check cycles:** Issues organized into Sprint 01‚Äì24
- [ ] **Test relationships:** Some issues marked as "Blocked by" (dependencies)
- [ ] **Validate labels:** Phase labels (phase-1, phase-2, etc.) applied
- [ ] **Set up views:** Create custom views for swimlanes (Backend/Frontend/DevOps/QA)
- [ ] **Configure notifications:** Set up team notifications for cycle starts

---

## Linear Views Setup (After Import)

### Create Swimlane Views

In Linear, create custom views for each team:

**View: "Backend Lane"**
```
Filter: Team = Backend
Sort By: Priority (High ‚Üí Low), then Estimate (Large ‚Üí Small)
Group By: Cycle (Sprint 01, Sprint 02, ...)
```

**View: "Frontend Lane"**
```
Filter: Team = Frontend
Sort By: Priority, then Estimate
Group By: Cycle
```

**View: "DevOps Lane"**
```
Filter: Team = DevOps
Sort By: Priority, then Estimate
Group By: Cycle
```

**View: "QA Lane"**
```
Filter: Team = QA
Sort By: Priority, then Estimate
Group By: Cycle
```

### Create Phase Views

**View: "Phase 1 (Foundation)"**
```
Filter: Labels includes "phase-1"
Sort By: Cycle, then Priority
Group By: Team
```

**View: "Critical Path"**
```
Filter: Labels includes "critical-path"
Sort By: Priority, then Estimate
Group By: Cycle
```

---

## Summary

| Method | Time | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|------|
| **CSV Import** | 5 min | Fast, easy, no coding | Manual column mapping |
| **Linear API** | 10 min | Bulk + automated | Requires API key + script |
| **Manual UI** | 60 min | Full control, visual | Slow for 120+ stories |

**Recommendation:** Start with **CSV Import** (Method 1) for simplicity. If you have many teams, consider **API** (Method 2) for speed.

---

> üí° **Pro Tip**: After import, create a "Sprint Planning" view in Linear filtered by Cycle + Team to run daily standups. Use cycle start dates to align with your 2-week sprint cadence.
