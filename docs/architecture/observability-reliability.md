## Stack

- Prometheus, Grafana, AlertManager
- ELK for logs; OpenTelemetry for traces
- Modulith actuator

## Practices

- SLOs by module; synthetic checks; DR drills
- Alert routing by severity; escalation policies

## SLOs & Alerting (Draft)

- Incident module: p95 createâ†’event publish < 50ms; read latencies < 150ms.
- Event publication: incomplete publications retry within 30m; backlog < 5k.
- Alerting: page on sustained SLO violation (>15m) or error rate > 2%.
- Runbooks: link per module to triage steps and dashboards.
