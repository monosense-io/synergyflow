Status: Draft

# Story
As a field technician,
I want mobile-friendly barcode/QR scanning flows to update asset status/location,
so that inventory changes are captured quickly on the go.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Endpoint accepts scan payload (asset identifier, timestamp, geolocation optional) and updates asset status/location/owner as permitted.
2. Validate scan source and permissions; reject invalid/unauthorized updates; audit each change with actor and rationale.
3. Support offline-friendly batching: accept batches of scans with idempotency keys; process with partial failures reported.
4. Emit asset.updated event with change summary; optionally attach scan metadata.
5. p95 processing latency ≤ 200ms per scan in batch under nominal load.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Scan update API (single and batch) with idempotency and validation (AC: 1, 3)
- [ ] Permission model for who can update what fields via scan (AC: 2)
- [ ] Audit and event emission (AC: 2, 4)
- [ ] Performance tuning and metrics (AC: 5)

## Dev Notes
- PRD: 2.8 ITAM — barcode/QR scanning updates
- Architecture: api-architecture.md; observability-reliability.md; data-architecture.md
- ADRs: 0007 gateway (mobile ingress), 0001 events, 0009 DB migrations
- APIs: cmdb.yaml/itam module; users.yaml for permissions

## Testing
- Single/batch scan flows; idempotency; permission checks
- Performance; event contracts; audit records
