Status: Draft

# Story
As a CMDB administrator,
I want a CI admin UI to manage CI types and CIs,
so that type schemas, ownership, and CI records are governed through a clear interface.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. CIType management screens: list/create/edit with schema editor (fields, required, formats) and validation preview.
2. CI management screens: list/filter (type, owner, status), create/edit with type-driven dynamic fields and validation errors.
3. Ownership assignment to users/teams with search; status transitions (active/retired) gated with confirmation and rationale.
4. Audit panel shows recent changes; RBAC hides admin actions from unauthorized users.
5. Accessibility and performance: lists p95 < 800ms; editor responsive; a11y AA.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] CIType list/editor with schema validation preview (AC: 1)
- [ ] CI list/create/edit with dynamic fields and validation (AC: 2)
- [ ] Ownership/Status controls with rationale (AC: 3)
- [ ] Audit panel and RBAC UI states (AC: 4)
- [ ] a11y/perf checks (AC: 5)
