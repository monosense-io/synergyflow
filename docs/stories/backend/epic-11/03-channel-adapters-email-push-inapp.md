Status: Draft

# Story
As a notifications platform engineer,
I want pluggable channel adapters for email, push, and in‑app with reliable delivery,
so that notifications reach users with retries, DLQ, and audit.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Define ChannelAdapter interface; implement EmailAdapter, PushAdapter, InAppAdapter; support provider config and health checks.
2. Delivery pipeline performs idempotent send with exponential backoff retries and DLQ on permanent failure; correlates request→delivery records.
3. Delivery model records status history (queued, sent, failed, retried), provider IDs, and timestamps; searchable APIs provided.
4. SLA: p95 send latency under nominal load per channel targets; backpressure controls/rate limits configurable per provider.
5. Events: notification.dispatched, notification.failed with context for observability and alerting.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] ChannelAdapter interface and implementations (email/push/in‑app) (AC: 1)
- [ ] Delivery pipeline with retries, idempotency, DLQ, backpressure (AC: 2, 4)
- [ ] Delivery record storage and searchable APIs (AC: 3)
- [ ] Emit events; provider health checks and configs (AC: 1, 5)
- [ ] Performance tests and rate limit policies (AC: 4)

## Dev Notes
- PRD: docs/prd/07-notification-system-design.md (channels & reliability)
- ADRs: 0008 mobile push egress; 0006 partitioning; 0001 event bus
- Architecture: observability-reliability.md (retries/metrics); gateway-envoy.md (egress policies)
- APIs: docs/api/modules/system.yaml (delivery search), docs/api/modules/events.yaml (events)

## Testing
- Adapter contract tests; retry/DLQ behavior; idempotency; provider failures
- Delivery status search; event contracts; performance and rate limits
