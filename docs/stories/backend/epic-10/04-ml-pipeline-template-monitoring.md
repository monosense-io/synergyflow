Status: Draft

# Story
As an ML engineer,
I want a templated ML pipeline with monitoring and drift detection,
so that models built on curated datasets are governed and observable.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Pipeline template defines stages (feature extraction, training, evaluation, packaging, registration, deployment) and artifacts tracked per run.
2. Model registry stores metadata (version, dataset contract, metrics, parameters) and lineage links to datasets.
3. Drift monitoring ingests live metrics (data/label drift proxies) and triggers alerts when thresholds are breached; events: ml.model.updated/drift.detected.
4. APIs to list models, view performance history, and trigger re‑training; permissions enforced.
5. Documentation and sample pipeline using one curated dataset; monitoring dashboards expose key metrics.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Pipeline template and artifact tracking (AC: 1)
- [ ] Model registry and lineage to datasets (AC: 2)
- [ ] Drift monitoring ingestion and alerting (AC: 3)
- [ ] Model APIs for list/history/retrain (AC: 4)
- [ ] Sample pipeline + docs + dashboards (AC: 5)

## Dev Notes
- PRD: 2.12 optional ML pipelines with monitoring
- Dependencies: Epic 09 dashboards for surfacing metrics
- Architecture: data-architecture.md; observability-reliability.md (SLOs)
- ADRs: 0006 event partitioning; 0001 event bus
- APIs/Events: system.yaml (models), events.yaml (ml.*)

## Testing
- Pipeline run artifact tracking; registry behaviors
- Drift detection thresholds and alerting; event contracts
- Permissions on retrain/visibility
