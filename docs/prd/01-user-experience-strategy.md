- Goals: Fast ticket resolution, efficient case management, access to knowledge
- Workflows: Ticket triage → investigation → resolution → documentation
- UI Needs: Consolidated agent desktop, quick actions, integrated knowledge search
- Success Metrics: Tickets resolved per hour, first-call resolution rate

**IT Operations Engineer**
- Goals: Infrastructure focus, technical depth, system integration
- Workflows: Monitoring alerts → diagnosis → remediation → documentation
- UI Needs: Technical terminology, advanced configuration, system integration tools
- Success Metrics: Mean time to resolution (MTTR), system availability

**End User (Technical)**
- Goals: Self-service capability, detailed system information, API access
- Workflows: Self-diagnosis → service request → status tracking → feedback
- UI Needs: Technical details, API documentation, advanced search
- Success Metrics: Self-service resolution rate, request fulfillment time

**End User (Non-Technical)**
- Goals: Simple request submission, clear status updates, guided workflows
- Workflows: Problem description → guided routing → status tracking → resolution
