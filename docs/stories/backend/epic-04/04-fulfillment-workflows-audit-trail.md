Status: Draft

# Story
As a fulfillment manager,
I want fulfillment workflows with task tracking and audit trails,
so that service requests are executed reliably with full visibility.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. On approval, fulfillment workflow (Flowable) starts and creates tasks with assignees, due dates, and SLA hooks.
2. Task state changes (started/completed/blocked) are audit logged; notifications sent on assignment/overdue.
3. Attachments and notes can be added to tasks; all changes are tracked with user and timestamp.
4. Expose APIs to list tasks by request/service/team; filters include status/assignee/date range.
5. Events: fulfillment.task.created/updated/completed; retry logic for notification failures.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Workflow start on approval and task creation (AC: 1)
- [ ] Task state machine and audit hooks (AC: 2)
- [ ] Attachments/notes handling with security (AC: 3)
- [ ] Task listing/filtering APIs (AC: 4)
- [ ] Event emissions and notification retries (AC: 5)

## Dev Notes
- PRD: 2.6 Service Catalog (fulfillment workflows and audit)
- Architecture: workflow-flowable.md; observability-reliability.md for retries
- ADRs: 0012 Flowable; 0001 events; 0004 versioning; 0011 cache (optional task lists)
- APIs: service-requests.yaml; users.yaml (assignees)

## Testing
- Workflow/task lifecycle tests; audit trail checks
- Filters and pagination tests; notification retry behavior
