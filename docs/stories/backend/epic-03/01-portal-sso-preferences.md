Status: Draft

# Story
As an end user and security admin,
I want SSO-backed portal access and persisted user preferences,
so that users have a secure, personalized experience across sessions and devices.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. SSO authentication configured per security architecture; sessions established and refreshed securely; logout supported.
2. User preferences (theme, locale, notifications) are stored/retrieved via API; defaults applied on first login.
3. Branding and localization configurations are served to the portal with cache headers; localization keys resolvable for UI.
4. RBAC prevents access to admin endpoints; preferences can only be modified by the subject user.
5. p95 latency for preferences/branding endpoints < 200ms under nominal load.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] SSO integration (OIDC/SAML as per security architecture) (AC: 1)
- [ ] Session management (refresh, logout) and CSRF protections (AC: 1)
- [ ] Preferences API (CRUD) with validation and defaults (AC: 2)
- [ ] Branding/localization config endpoints with caching (AC: 3)
- [ ] RBAC/ABAC checks and tests (AC: 4)
- [ ] Performance tuning and metrics (AC: 5)

## Dev Notes
- PRD: docs/prd/02-itil-v4-core-features-specification.md (2.5 Portal: SSO, preferences, branding/localization)
- Architecture: docs/architecture/security-architecture.md, docs/architecture/api-architecture.md
- ADRs: 0007 API gateway placement/scope; 0008 mobile push egress policy (if push used); 0001 event bus for login events (optional)
- APIs: docs/api/modules/users.yaml (profile/preferences), docs/api/modules/system.yaml (branding/localization)

## Testing
- AuthN/AuthZ integration tests (happy-path, token expiry, logout)
- Preferences CRUD and defaults; cache headers for branding/localization
- Performance p95 checks; security tests for access controls
