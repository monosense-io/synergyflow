# Story
As a software asset manager,
I want license usage monitoring and compliance alerts,
so that we detect overuse and maintain compliance with entitlements.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Track LicenseEntitlement per product with seats/terms; map assets/users to entitlements.
2. Compute usage vs entitlements and thresholds; generate alerts when approaching or breaching limits.
3. Expose compliance reports by product and team with filters and export (CSV/JSON).
4. Emit license.threshold.breached event with context; notifications sent to owners.
5. Reconciliation job to recalc usage periodically; audit of changes to entitlements and mappings.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] LicenseEntitlement model and mapping (AC: 1)
- [ ] Usage computation and thresholds; reconciliation job (AC: 2, 5)
- [ ] Reports API and export (AC: 3)
- [ ] Event emission and notifications (AC: 4)
- [ ] Audit trail for entitlement changes (AC: 5)

## Dev Notes
- PRD: 2.8 ITAM â€” license compliance and alerts
- Architecture: data-architecture.md; observability-reliability.md (jobs)
- ADRs: 0001 event bus; 0009 DB migrations; 0011 cache (optional for reports)
- APIs: system.yaml (reports), cmdb.yaml/itam module

## Testing
- Usage calculations; threshold alerts; reconciliation correctness
- Reports filters and export correctness; event contracts
