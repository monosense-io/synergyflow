Status: Draft

# Story
As a release engineer,
I want a Quality Gate evaluation service integrated with CI/CD,
so that builds fail when tests and policies are not satisfied.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Gate definitions configurable: minimum coverage thresholds, contract tests pass, security scan passes, performance budgets, and flakiness limits.
2. Gate evaluator consumes test reports (unit/integration/E2E), contract/event results, and tool outputs; computes GateResult with pass/fail and rationale.
3. CI integration step calls evaluator and propagates failure with detailed summary; exports JUnit‑compatible results.
4. regression.suite.passed event emitted on success with metadata; on failure, includes failing gates and links to artifacts.
5. Admin API to define/override gates per branch/environment with audit; server‑side enforcement for merge gates.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Gate schema and evaluator implementation (AC: 1, 2)
- [ ] CI integration step and result exporter (AC: 3)
- [ ] Events emission and artifact links (AC: 4)
- [ ] Admin API with audit and per‑env overrides (AC: 5)

## Dev Notes
- PRD: verification gates and acceptance coverage
- Architecture: testing-architecture.md; observability-reliability.md (metrics); gateway-envoy.md (policy)
- ADRs: 0004 event versioning; 0009 DB migration policy
- APIs/Events: system.yaml (gates), event regression.suite.passed

## Testing
- Gate pass/fail scenarios; artifact linking; CI integration; admin overrides with audit
