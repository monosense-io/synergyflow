Status: Draft

# Story
As a change manager and incident commander,
I want an impact analysis panel embedded in Change and Incident UIs,
so that I can see affected CIs/services and risk at a glance.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Panel shows impact summary (blast radius, criticality, impacted services) and a mini-graph for affected CIs with expand-on-click.
2. For changes, panel appears pre-approval and on updates; shows pass/fail of gate thresholds based on impact size and policy.
3. For incidents, panel updates with current CI context and suggests escalation targets based on dependencies.
4. Real-time refresh when CMDB changes affect the impact set; cache with invalidation; UI shows last updated time.
5. Accessibility and performance: render p95 < 600ms; responsive.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Impact panel component with summary and mini-graph (AC: 1)
- [ ] Change UI integration with gate status (AC: 2)
- [ ] Incident UI integration with escalation suggestions (AC: 3)
- [ ] Real-time refresh hooks and cache indicators (AC: 4)
- [ ] a11y/perf checks (AC: 5)
