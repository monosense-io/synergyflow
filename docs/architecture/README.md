## Key Design Principles

### 1. **Event-Driven Modular Monolith**
- Spring Modulith ApplicationEvents for inter-module communication
- Transactional outbox pattern ensures reliable delivery
- Natural migration path to Kafka for future scale

### 2. **CQRS with Eventual Consistency**
- Write side: Commands update PostgreSQL aggregate roots
- Read side: Event consumers build projections
- Freshness badges make projection lag transparent to users

### 3. **Policy-Driven Automation**
- OPA (Open Policy Agent) for declarative authorization and routing
- Every decision generates explainable receipt
- Shadow mode testing before production rollout

### 4. **Boring Technology for Stability**
- Spring Boot 3.5.6, Spring Modulith 1.4.2, PostgreSQL 16.8
- DragonflyDB 1.17.0 for high-performance caching
- Flowable 7.1.0 for workflow orchestration
- Proven at scale, strong community support

## Contributing

When updating architecture documentation:

1. **Keep main architecture.md concise** (‚â§10 lines for code examples)
2. **Move full implementations to appendices** (appendix-NN-*.md format)
3. **Reference appendices** with section numbers for clarity
4. **Update this README** with new appendix descriptions
5. **Run validation report** after major changes

See [validation-report-2025-10-17.md](./validation-report-2025-10-17.md) for detailed quality standards.
