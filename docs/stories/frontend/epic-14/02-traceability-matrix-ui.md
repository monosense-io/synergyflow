Status: Draft

# Story
As a QA lead and product owner,
I want a traceability matrix UI,
so that I can visualize coverage from acceptance criteria to automated tests.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Matrix view by epic/story/feature shows AC items mapped to tests (pass/fail/na) and coverage %.
2. Filters by module, epic, service, and status; search by AC ID or test ID; export CSV/PDF.
3. Clicking a cell opens details with Given‑When‑Then text and latest test run result; allows adding/removing TraceLinks (authorized roles).
4. Stale/orphan tests flagged; suggestions to link based on heuristics; audit of manual link edits.
5. Accessibility and performance: load p95 < 1s for typical scopes; a11y AA.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Matrix rendering with filters/search and exports (AC: 1, 2)
- [ ] Cell details and link management with audit (AC: 3)
- [ ] Stale/orphan flags and suggestions (AC: 4)
- [ ] a11y/perf checks (AC: 5)

## Dev Notes
- Backend: docs/stories/backend/epic-14/04-traceability-reporting-service.md
- PRD: testing strategy — traceability
- Architecture/UX: docs/ux/README.md; gateway‑envoy.md
- APIs: system.yaml (traceability)

## Testing
- Coverage correctness; link edits with audit; exports; a11y/perf
