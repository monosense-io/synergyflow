# Story
As a knowledge reviewer,
I want an approval queue UI with review actions and audit visibility,
so that I can efficiently review and publish articles.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Queue lists pending reviews with filters (tag, owner, age); shows diff from previous version.
2. Reviewers can approve or request changes with rationale; actions reflected immediately; notifications sent.
3. Publish button available when requirements met; disabled otherwise with explanation.
4. Audit panel shows history of review actions for the article/version.
5. Accessibility and performance: list p95 < 800ms; interactions responsive.
