## Summary
- Overall: 5/10 passed (50%)
- Critical Issues: 3 (structure + missing story and tasks)

## Section Results

### Story Context Assembly
Pass Rate: 5/10 (50%)

✗ FAIL Story fields (asA/iWant/soThat) captured
- Evidence: No `<story>` block found; expected `<asA>`, `<iWant>`, `<soThat>` per template. In source story markdown (ancillary doc) lines 7–10 provide the statement:
  - docs/stories/story-00.2.md:7–10: “As a support agent, I want … so that …”
- Impact: Context file should encapsulate the story statement for downstream agents; omission breaks self-contained guidance.

✓ PASS Acceptance criteria list matches story draft exactly (no invention)
- Evidence (XML):
  - L19–23: `<ac id="1">…</ac>` … `<ac id="5">…</ac>`
- Evidence (Story):
  - docs/stories/story-00.2.md:13–17 numbered ACs align 1–5 with identical semantics.

✗ FAIL Tasks/subtasks captured as task list
- Evidence: No tasks section present in XML; template expects `<story><tasks>…</tasks></story>`.
- Evidence (Story): docs/stories/story-00.2.md:21–40 contains tasks; not reflected in XML.
- Impact: Implementers lack consolidated task list in context bundle.

⚠ PARTIAL Relevant docs (5-15) included with path and snippets
- Evidence: L11–16 include 5 doc paths, but no snippets/excerpts.
- Impact: Reviewers must open docs manually; checklist requires snippets to make context self-contained.

⚠ PARTIAL Relevant code references included with reason and line hints
- Evidence: L38–45 list 6 files with `path` and `kind`, but no `reason` or `lines` attributes.
- Impact: Missing why-each-file and where to look hinders efficiency.

✓ PASS Interfaces/API contracts extracted if applicable
- Evidence: L47 shows REST API signature `POST /api/v1/time-entries`.

✓ PASS Constraints include applicable dev rules and patterns
- Evidence: L49–53 list outbox/idempotency, correlation IDs, RFC7807.

✓ PASS Dependencies detected from manifests and frameworks
- Evidence: L26–36 include backend and frontend stacks (Spring Boot, Modulith, PostgreSQL; Next.js, TypeScript, TanStack Query).

✓ PASS Testing standards and locations populated
- Evidence: L55–60 include standards and locations; ideas present at L61–63.

✗ FAIL XML structure follows story-context template format
- Evidence: Root element is `<storyContext>` but template requires `<story-context>`; metadata/content element names differ (e.g., `<meta>` vs `<metadata>`, `<acceptanceCriteria>` should be a single element with templated content), and missing `<story>` block with fields.
- Impact: Downstream tooling expecting the template schema may not parse this file.

## Failed Items
1. Story fields not captured in XML (missing `<story>` with `<asA>`, `<iWant>`, `<soThat>`)
2. Tasks/subtasks not captured in XML
3. XML structure deviates from required template (root/metadata names, section layout)

## Partial Items
1. Docs listed without snippets
2. Code references lack reasons and line hints

## Recommendations
1. Must Fix:
   - Regenerate context using the provided template at `bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/story-context/context-template.xml` so the structure matches (`<story-context>`, `<metadata>`, `<story>` fields, etc.).
   - Populate `<story>` with asA/iWant/soThat and include `<tasks>` derived from the story markdown.
2. Should Improve:
   - For each doc under `<artifacts><docs>`, include concise quoted snippets with line refs supporting ACs and constraints.
   - For each `<code><file>`, add `reason` and `lines` attributes to guide reviewers.
3. Consider:
   - Add additional interfaces if bulk-time entry differs from single-entry endpoint (e.g., `POST /api/v1/time-entries:bulk`).

Additional cross-checks (not in checklist)
- Story references this context file: docs/stories/story-00.2.md:95 contains link to `./story-context-00.00.2.xml`.
