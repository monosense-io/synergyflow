# Story
As a release planner,
I want an interactive change calendar UI with conflict visualization and governed overrides,
so that I can schedule safely and document exceptions.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Calendar UI displays scheduled changes with filters (service, team, environment, risk tier) and supports month/week/day views.
2. **Conflict Interaction**:
   - A conflict is indicated with a clear visual marker on the change event.
   - **Hovering** over the marker shows a simple tooltip with the conflict name (e.g., "Production Freeze").
   - **Clicking** the change event opens a stable view (e.g., side panel) with full conflict details and the "Request Override" CTA.
3. **Override Workflow & Audit**:
   - **Authorized users** can request an override via the conflict details view. The UI enforces providing a rationale.
   - For **unauthorized users**, the override CTA is disabled. A tooltip explains the required role/permission and guides the user on next steps.
   - After an override is approved, the change event displays a permanent icon (e.g., a shield). Clicking this icon shows the read-only audit trail (who, when, why).
4. **Information Density & Performance**:
   - Performance p95 < 1s for a month view with 1000 items.
   - To manage visual density, if a day has more than 3 events, the UI displays an aggregated item (e.g., "+5 more"). Clicking this item navigates to the day view or opens a popover listing all events.
5. **Accessibility & Usability**:
   - Fully keyboard navigable.
   - Meets WCAG AA contrast and ARIA label standards.
   - Responsive layout for common screen sizes.
   - All interactions are timezone-aware and DST-safe.
