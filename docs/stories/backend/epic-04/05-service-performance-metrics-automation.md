# Story
As a service portfolio manager,
I want service performance metrics (volume, fulfillment time, CSAT) and automation hooks,
so that we can monitor outcomes and auto-fulfill standard requests.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Compute and expose metrics per service/period: request volume, avg/median fulfillment time, SLA attainment, CSAT.
2. Provide query APIs with filters (service, team, date range) and export (CSV/JSON); paginate results.
3. Define automation rules for standard requests (no approvals) and execute auto-fulfillment tasks; audit and safety limits apply.
4. p95 metrics query latency ≤ 1s on 90‑day dataset with indexing/caching.
5. Events: automation.task.executed/failed; metrics.updated (optional for dashboards).

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Metrics aggregation jobs and storage (AC: 1)
- [ ] Query/export APIs with filters/pagination (AC: 2)
- [ ] Automation rule engine and execution with audit (AC: 3)
- [ ] Caching/indexing for performance (AC: 4)
- [ ] Event emissions for automation/metrics (AC: 5)

## Dev Notes
- PRD: 2.6 Service Catalog (metrics; automated fulfillment for standard requests)
- Architecture: data-architecture.md; observability-reliability.md; gateway-envoy.md
- ADRs: 0011 cache store for performance; 0001 events; 0004 versioning
- APIs: service-requests.yaml; system.yaml for metrics/automation endpoints

## Testing
- Aggregation correctness and performance tests
- Automation safety limits and audit tests
- API filters/export correctness
