# Story
As a change administrator,
I want Flowable-based change workflow modeling and versioned deployment,
so that governed change processes can be authored, validated, and executed reliably.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Support import/export of BPMN 2.0 change workflows (JSON/XML) with versioning and metadata (owner, description, created/updated).
2. Deploy a selected model version to the embedded Flowable engine with validation; failed validation blocks deployment and reports errors.
3. Maintain deployment history with ability to roll back to a previous version (deployment records immutable, audited).
4. Expose APIs to list, get, create, update, validate, deploy, and rollback workflows; RBAC enforced for admin roles.
5. Emit events: change.workflow.created/updated, change.workflow.deployed, change.workflow.rollback with version info.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Model repository (CRUD, versioning, metadata) (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Import/export BPMN (JSON/XML) (AC: 1)
- [ ] Validation pipeline using Flowable APIs (AC: 2)
- [ ] Deployment service and history recording (AC: 2, 3)
- [ ] Rollback and immutability of deployment records (AC: 3)
- [ ] Admin RBAC policies and API endpoints (AC: 4)
- [ ] Event emissions for lifecycle (AC: 5)

## Dev Notes
- PRD alignment: docs/prd/02-itil-v4-core-features-specification.md (2.3 Change Management)
- Architecture: docs/architecture/workflow-flowable.md; API gateway: docs/architecture/gateway-envoy.md
- ADRs: 0012 Flowable orchestration; 0001 Event bus; 0004 Event versioning; 0007 Gateway placement
- APIs: docs/api/modules/changes.yaml (extend with workflow endpoints), docs/api/modules/system.yaml (validation)
- Data: WorkflowModel, WorkflowVersion, DeploymentRecord, AuditLog

## Testing
- Validation failure scenarios (malformed BPMN, missing nodes) block deployment
- Versioning semantics (latest, specific version) and rollback behavior
- RBAC tests for admin-only endpoints
- Event contract tests for workflow lifecycle events
