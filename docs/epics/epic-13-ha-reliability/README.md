# Epic 13 — High Availability & Reliability

## Epic Goal
Achieve target reliability through HA design, resiliency patterns, observability, and SLOs (PRD 9, 12).

## Scope
- In scope: HA posture, graceful degradation, retries/circuit breakers, DR objectives, metrics/tracing/logging, reliability reviews.
- Out of scope: Multi-region active/active unless prioritized.

## Key Requirements
- PRD 9/12: HA & reliability architecture; performance & reliability requirements; SLOs and operational runbooks.

Refs: docs/prd/09-high-availability-reliability-architecture.md, docs/prd/12-enhanced-performance-reliability-requirements.md

## Architecture & ADR References
- HA posture: docs/adrs/0003-ha-posture-single-dc-rack-ha.md
- Event partitioning: docs/adrs/0006-event-publication-partitioning-retention.md
- Cache store: docs/adrs/0011-cache-store-dragonflydb-over-redis.md
- Gateway: docs/adrs/0010-envoy-gateway-adoption-k8s-gateway-api.md, docs/architecture/gateway-envoy.md
- Observability: docs/architecture/observability-reliability.md

## API & Events Impact
- APIs: docs/api/modules/system.yaml
- Events: health.signal, slo.breach, degradation.entered/recovered

## Data Model Impact
- Entities: SLO, ErrorBudget, ReliabilityReview, IncidentTrend.
- Refs: docs/prd/18-data-model-overview.md

## Dependencies
- Epic 11 (Notifications) for alerts; Epic 16 (Deployment & Ops) for rollout strategies; domain epics for SLO coverage.

## Risks & Mitigation
- Hidden single points of failure → architecture review gates; chaos drills.
- Observability gaps → SLO-first instrumentation requirement.

## Acceptance Criteria (Epic)
- SLOs defined and measured; HA posture implemented; observability dashboards and runbooks in place; failover drills executed.

## Story Seeds
1) SLO definitions and monitoring.
2) Resiliency middleware (timeouts, retries, circuit breakers).
3) Chaos scenarios and runbooks.
4) Error budget policy and gating.

## Verification & Done
- Chaos/regression tests; SLO reports; failover drill logs.
