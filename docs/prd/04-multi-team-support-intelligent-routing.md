## 4. Multi-Team Support & Intelligent Routing

### 4.1 Team Structure
**Hierarchical Organization**:
- Organization → Departments → Teams → Agents
- Skill matrices per agent (technical areas, expertise levels)
- Workload balancing algorithms
- Holiday and availability management

### 4.2 Intelligent Routing Engine

**Routing Criteria**:
1. **Category Matching**: Service catalog categories to team specializations
2. **Skill Matching**: Technical keywords to agent expertise
3. **Workload Balancing**: Current ticket count and priority distribution
4. **SLA Optimization**: Route to teams with best SLA performance
5. **Business Hours**: Timezone-aware routing for global teams

**Routing Algorithm**:
```
Priority Score = (Skill Match × 50%) + 
                (Category Match × 25%) + 
                (SLA Performance × 15%) + 
                (Customer Criticality × 5%) + 
                (Availability × 5%)
```

**Additional Routing Factors**:
- Time zone alignment for global teams
- Agent certification levels and expertise depth
- Customer/service criticality (VIP, critical services)
- Previous resolution success rate for similar issues
- Team customer satisfaction scores

**Escalation Rules**:
- Level 1: Initial assignment to primary team
- Level 2: Cross-team escalation after SLA threshold
- Level 3: Management escalation for critical issues
- Auto-escalation triggers: SLA breach, customer escalation, severity upgrade
