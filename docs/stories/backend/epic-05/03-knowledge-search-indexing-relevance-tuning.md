Status: Draft

# Story
As an end user and support agent,
I want fast, relevant knowledge search with snippet previews,
so that I can find the right content quickly.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Index KnowledgeArticle/ArticleVersion with fields (title, body, tags) and relevance tuning (boost recency, tags, ratings); p95 search < 800ms.
2. Query API supports filters (category/tags/owner), typo tolerance, and returns highlighted snippets.
3. Synonym and stemming management endpoints allow admin updates; changes applied without downtime.
4. Usage telemetry informs relevance tuning; A/B flags available for ranking changes.
5. Results exclude Draft articles; Published only; permissions respected.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Indexer and incremental updates on article/version changes (AC: 1)
- [ ] Query API with filters and highlights (AC: 2)
- [ ] Synonym/stemming config endpoints and hot-reload (AC: 3)
- [ ] Telemetry capture and A/B toggle mechanism (AC: 4)
- [ ] Visibility filters for status/permissions (AC: 5)

## Dev Notes
- PRD: 2.7 Knowledge Management â€” relevance-ranked search and suggestions
- ADRs: 0011 cache store (result caching); 0001 event bus; 0004 versioning
- Architecture: data-architecture.md for indexing choices; observability-reliability.md for latency SLO
- APIs: search.yaml; knowledge.yaml for index feeds

## Testing
- Relevance tests (boosting and ranking) with fixtures
- Performance tests under load; caching effectiveness
- Filter/visibility correctness and snippet highlighting
