# Story 00.1: Event System Implementation (Transactional Outbox)

Status: Done

## Story

As a backend developer,
I want a reliable in-process event system with durable publication and correlation/causation tracking,
so that modules communicate consistently and downstream consumers can process events idempotently with full observability.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All domain events are published as Java records via Spring Modulith ApplicationEvents and persisted in `event_publication` (transactional outbox) with retry/status fields.
2. Correlation and causation IDs propagate across module boundaries and outbound API calls; logs and traces include these IDs.
3. Event consumers are idempotent and integration tests verify no duplicate side-effects under retry scenarios.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Define event base types and correlation/causation ID utilities (AC: #1, #2)
  - [x] Add Java record base and helpers for IDs
  - [x] Ensure MDC and OpenTelemetry contexts include IDs
- [x] Implement transactional outbox persistence (AC: #1)
  - [x] Create Flyway migration for `event_publication` table (indexes, status fields)
  - [x] Configure outbox publisher and retry/backoff strategy
- [x] Refactor at least one module (Incident) to publish a domain event (AC: #1)
  - [x] Publish `IncidentCreated` with full metadata
  - [x] Verify event written to outbox with correct payload and IDs
- [x] Build idempotent consumer example and test harness (AC: #3)
  - [x] Implement consumer with idempotency key check
  - [x] Add integration tests to simulate duplicate deliveries
- [x] Observability and dashboards (AC: #2, #3)
  - [x] Emit metrics for event lag, error rate, retries
  - [x] Add Grafana panels for outbox lag and consumer errors

### Action Items from Review

- [x] Create backend project scaffolding (Gradle or Maven) with Spring Boot 3.5.x + Spring Modulith 1.4.x
- [x] Implement EventBase (Java record) with correlationId/causationId and helper utilities
- [x] Enable JDBC event publication registry; configure outbox publisher with retry/backoff
- [x] Add Flyway migrations for event_publication and processed_events with required indexes
- [x] Implement publication of IncidentCreatedEvent and one idempotent consumer example
- [x] Add integration tests (Testcontainers + Spring Modulith Test): outbox persistence, correlation propagation, idempotent consumer duplicates
- [x] Add metrics and dashboards for outbox lag, retries, consumer errors

## Dev Notes

- Architecture pattern: Modular Monolith with Spring Modulith and transactional outbox (see docs/architecture/architecture.md Sections 5–6).
- Data model: `event_publication` table with payload, status, next_attempt_at, attempts counters, correlation_id, causation_id.
- Tracing: Propagate IDs via MDC and OpenTelemetry; include in log_line_prefix and headers.
- Testing: Integration tests for outbox retry and consumer idempotency; contract tests for event schema evolution guidelines.

### Project Structure Notes

- Backend module publishes events from `apps/backend` following package boundaries described in the proposed source tree.
- Incident module emits `IncidentCreated`; future work extends to `IncidentAssigned`, `IncidentResolved`.
