Status: Draft

# Story
As an operations manager,
I want SLA timers with pre-breach alerts,
so that teams can proactively act before SLA violations occur.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. SLA timers start at incident creation and update on status changes per SLA policy.
2. Pre-breach alerts trigger at configurable thresholds (e.g., 80%) and route to the assigned team/channel.
3. Timers are resilient across restarts and clock skew (use monotonic time); persisted state survives failures.
4. Alerts are deduplicated and audit logged with delivery status.
5. Configurable per category/service/team with sensible defaults.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] SLA policy model and configuration (AC: 5)
- [ ] Durable timer engine using persistence and monotonic time (AC: 1, 3)
- [ ] Threshold evaluation and pre-breach alert generation (AC: 2)
- [ ] Alert routing to Notifications module with dedupe (AC: 2, 4)
- [ ] Audit logging of alerts, including retries and outcomes (AC: 4)

## Dev Notes
- PRD 2.1 (Incident Management) â€” SLA timers and pre-breach alerts
- Notifications dependency: Epic 11 (docs/epics/epic-11-notifications/README.md) and docs/prd/07-notification-system-design.md
- ADRs: event partitioning for scale (docs/adrs/0006-event-publication-partitioning-retention.md); mobile push policy (0008) if used
- Architecture: Observability & reliability (docs/architecture/observability-reliability.md) for timer SLOs
- APIs: incidents.yaml for SLA fields; system.yaml for scheduling hooks; events.yaml for alert events (sla.warning)

## Testing
- Timer correctness with simulated time and restarts
- Pre-breach thresholds per config matrix (category/service/team)
- Dedupe and retry behavior on alerting
- Contract/event tests for sla.warning
