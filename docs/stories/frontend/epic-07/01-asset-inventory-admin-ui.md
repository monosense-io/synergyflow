Status: Draft

# Story
As an ITAM administrator,
I want an asset inventory admin UI for searching, filtering, and managing assets,
so that I can maintain accurate records and governance.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. List view with filters (type, owner, status, location) and pagination; CSV export of current filter results.
2. Create/Edit forms with type-specific fields; validations; lifecycle actions (assign, transfer, retire) with rationale.
3. Audit preview shows recent lifecycle events for selected asset.
4. RBAC: admin-only create/edit/retire; others read-only; unauthorized actions hidden/disabled.
5. Performance and accessibility: list p95 < 800ms; a11y AA compliance.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] List/filter/sort with pagination and export (AC: 1)
- [ ] Create/Edit forms with type-specific fields and validations (AC: 2)
- [ ] Lifecycle action flows with rationale (AC: 2)
- [ ] Audit preview panel (AC: 3)
- [ ] RBAC UI states and a11y/perf checks (AC: 4, 5)
