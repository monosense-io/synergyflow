# Story
As a compliance officer,
I want a centralized audit pipeline with signed, immutable logs,
so that security‑relevant events are tamper‑evident and queryable for audits.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. AuditEvent model captures actor, action, resource, result, IP/device, correlation ID, and timestamp; events normalized across modules.
2. Signing pipeline creates tamper‑evident audit logs (hash chain or external signing); writes to WORM‑like storage with retention controls.
3. Ingestion APIs accept audit events from services; backpressure, batching, and retries; DLQ for malformed events.
4. Query APIs support filters (actor, action, resource, timeframe, result) and export with PII redaction; large queries paginated.
5. security.audit.logged event emitted for monitoring; integrity verification tool validates signatures/chains.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] AuditEvent schema and normalization library (AC: 1)
- [ ] Signing + WORM storage writer with retention policy (AC: 2)
- [ ] Ingestion endpoints with backpressure and DLQ (AC: 3)
- [ ] Query/export APIs with redaction; integrity verifier tool (AC: 4, 5)
- [ ] Service SDK for uniform audit emission (AC: 1, 3)

## Dev Notes
- PRD: docs/prd/13-security-compliance-framework.md (auditability)
- Architecture: security-architecture.md; observability-reliability.md (pipelines)
- ADRs: 0001 event bus; 0009 DB migrations; 0004 contract versioning (audit schemas)
- APIs: system.yaml (audit ingest/query)

## Testing
- Signature/chain verification; retention enforcement
- Ingest error handling; DLQ behavior; query redaction correctness
- Load/performance tests for ingestion and query
