Decision

- Spring Cloud Gateway was selected as ingress for REST/GraphQL/Webhooks;
  internal/external routes; centralized auth, rate limiting, and observability.
  Superseded by ADRâ€‘0010 adopting Envoy Gateway (Kubernetes Gateway API).

Rationale

- Consistent security and policy enforcement; single front door.

Consequences

- Gateway HA must match app SLOs; careful route ownership and versioning.
