Status: Draft

# Story
As a DevOps engineer,
I want CI/CD workflows with environment promotion and gate checks,
so that deployments are automated, repeatable, and safe.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. CI/CD pipelines defined for build, test, package, deploy across envs (dev→stg→prod) with manual approvals where required.
2. Integrate quality gates (Epic 14) and error budget gates (Epic 13) before promotion; failed gates block with rationale links.
3. Promotion requires signed artifacts, provenance, and environment parity checks; emits deploy.started/completed with metadata.
4. Canary/blue‑green hooks available for Epic 16.03; rollback procedure documented and automatable.
5. Audit all pipeline actions; permissions enforced for approvals; metrics exported (deployment lead time, change failure rate).

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Define CI/CD workflows and environment configs (AC: 1)
- [ ] Gate integrations (quality + error budget) (AC: 2)
- [ ] Artifact signing/provenance and parity checks (AC: 3)
- [ ] Events emission and rollback scripts (AC: 3, 4)
- [ ] Audit, permissions, and metrics export (AC: 5)

## Dev Notes
- PRD: docs/prd/20-deployment-operations.md
- Dependencies: Epic 14 gates; Epic 13 error budgets; Epic 02 release orchestration
- Architecture/ADRs: deployment-architecture.md; 0010 Envoy Gateway; 0009 DB migrations (for env setup)
- APIs/Events: system.yaml (deploy endpoints); events (deploy.started/completed, rollback.executed)

## Testing
- Pipeline dry‑runs; gate fail/pass scenarios; rollback drills; metrics presence
