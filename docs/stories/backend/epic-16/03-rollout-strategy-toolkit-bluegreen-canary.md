Status: Draft

# Story
As a release engineer,
I want a rollout strategy toolkit for blue/green and canary deployments,
so that risk is reduced and rollbacks are quick.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Provide blue/green switch with traffic shifting and health checks; automated cutover and instant rollback.
2. Canary controller supports percentage‑based rollouts with automated promotion/abort based on KPIs (errors, latency, SLOs).
3. Policy templates define thresholds and evaluation windows; environment‑specific overrides allowed; evidence logged.
4. Metrics/traces/alerts integrated; deploy.started/completed/rollback.executed events enriched with rollout context.
5. Admin/API controls to start/pause/abort canary and switch blue/green; RBAC/audit enforced.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Blue/green switch and traffic management (AC: 1)
- [ ] Canary controller and KPI evaluator (AC: 2)
- [ ] Policy templates and overrides (AC: 3)
- [ ] Metrics/trace hooks and enriched events (AC: 4)
- [ ] Admin/API controls + RBAC/audit (AC: 5)

## Dev Notes
- PRD: docs/prd/20-deployment-operations.md (rollout, rollback)
- Architecture/ADRs: gateway‑envoy.md; 0010 Envoy Gateway; observability-reliability.md
- Events/APIs: system.yaml (rollout admin), events (deploy.*, rollback.executed)

## Testing
- Simulated canaries (pass/fail); blue/green cutover/rollback; KPI threshold tests
