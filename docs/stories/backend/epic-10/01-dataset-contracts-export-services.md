Status: Draft

# Story
As a data platform engineer,
I want versioned dataset contracts and export services,
so that curated datasets are consistent, governed, and consumable by BI/ML.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Define DataContract with name, owners, version, schema (fields, types, PII flags), SLAs, and change policy; contracts are immutable per version.
2. Dataset entity references a DataContract version and storage targets; publish/unpublish workflow with audit.
3. Export services produce contract‑conformant outputs (e.g., Parquet/CSV) to configured sinks and/or warehouse tables with naming conventions.
4. Backward compatibility: add/remove/change fields validated against policy; incompatible changes rejected or version bumped.
5. PII governance: masking/pseudonymization applied per field policy on export; access logged.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] DataContract and Dataset models + migrations (AC: 1, 2)
- [ ] Contract schema validator and compatibility checker (AC: 4)
- [ ] Export writer for Parquet/CSV and warehouse loader (AC: 3)
- [ ] Publish/unpublish workflow with audit (AC: 2)
- [ ] PII masking/pseudonymization hooks and access logging (AC: 5)

## Dev Notes
- PRD: docs/prd/02-itil-v4-core-features-specification.md (2.12 Advanced Analytics Integration)
- Architecture: docs/architecture/data-architecture.md
- ADRs: 0006 event partitioning (if streaming), 0009 DB migration policy
- APIs: openapi.yaml (export endpoints), system.yaml

## Testing
- Contract validation and compatibility rules
- Export format correctness and naming conventions
- PII masking behavior; publish/unpublish audit
