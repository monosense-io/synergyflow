## Part 1: Requirement Clarity Analysis

### Vagueness Findings

**Finding 1: "Intelligent Routing" Definition (Medium Priority)**

**Location:** PRD Section "Multi-Team Support and Intelligent Routing" (FR-17)

**Issue:** "Intelligent routing" not precisely defined. What makes routing "intelligent"?

**What's Clear:**
- Skills-based matching (documented)
- Capacity-aware assignment (documented)
- SLA-based escalation (documented)

**What's Vague:**
- How is "skill match" scored? (Exact algorithm undefined)
- How is "capacity" measured? (Active incident count? Time estimate?)
- When does escalation trigger? (SLA breach imminent? Already breached?)

**Architecture Impact:** Low - OPA policies will formalize these rules during Phase 2, but MVP can defer to manual routing

**Recommendation:** Create "Routing Policy Definition" document in Phase 2 (Epic-06) before implementation begins

**Owner:** Product/Architecture team
**Timeline:** Week 1 of Epic-06 sprint

---

**Finding 2: "Eventual Consistency" User Experience (Medium Priority)**

**Location:** PRD Section "Freshness Badges" (FR-4)

**Issue:** How long is "acceptable" projection lag before users perceive system as broken?

**What's Clear:**
- Freshness badges show lag (1-3 seconds = green, 3-10 seconds = yellow, >10 seconds = red)
- In-memory event bus targets <100ms lag (p95 <200ms)

**What's Vague:**
- What happens at >10 seconds? Does system block operations?
- Should stale data be marked as "read-only" or displayed normally?
- How do users handle "linked incident just created but not visible in list yet"?

**Architecture Impact:** Medium - Freshness badge thresholds affect UX, but current design is sound

**Recommendation:** UX team to define "acceptable staleness" thresholds per data type during design phase

**Owner:** UX/Frontend team
**Timeline:** Before frontend sprint begins

---

**Finding 3: "Policy-Driven Automation" Governance (Medium Priority)**

**Location:** PRD Section "Policy Studio MVP + Decision Receipts" (FR-5, FR-19)

**Issue:** Who approves policies before deployment? What's the approval workflow?

**What's Clear:**
- Policies can be tested in shadow mode before production
- Decision receipts are generated for explainability
- OPA policies are versioned in Git

**What's Vague:**
- Who can write/modify policies? (Developers only? Product? Business analysts?)
- Is there a code review process for policies?
- What's the SLA for policy approvals?
- How are policy rollbacks handled?

**Architecture Impact:** Low - OPA is flexible enough to support various governance models

**Recommendation:** Define "Policy Governance Framework" document in Phase 2 (Epic-5)

**Owner:** Security/Compliance team
**Timeline:** Before Phase 2 policy expansion

---

### Over-Specification Findings

**Finding 1: Very Detailed Non-MVP Features**

**Location:** PRD Epic-20 (Advanced Automation)

**Issue:** Over-specification of Phase 2 features (Impact Orchestrator, Self-Healing Engine) may create unrealistic expectations

**Current State:** Well-scoped to Phase 2, but detailed descriptions might make product team expect these in MVP

**Recommendation:** Document why these features are deferred (complexity, data requirements, adoption risk)

**Owner:** Product team
**Timeline:** Pre-MVP kickoff communication

---

**Finding 2: Deployment Target Detail**

**Location:** PRD Section "Deployment Intent"

**Issue:** Very specific deployment targets (10 beta orgs month 0-3, 10 production orgs month 3-6) may constrain sales/marketing flexibility

**Current State:** These are stated as "targets" not "requirements," so flexibility is preserved

**Recommendation:** Communicate these are targets, not hard constraints

**Owner:** Product/Marketing alignment
**Timeline:** Before beta launch

## Part 3: Phasing Logic Validation

### MVP vs Phase 2 Separation - Verified ✅

| Epic | MVP | Phase 2 | Rationale | Risk |
|------|-----|---------|-----------|------|
| Epic-00 (Trust + UX) | ✅ All 5 stories | - | Foundation for all features | LOW |
| Epic-01 (Incidents) | ✅ Basic CRUD + SLA | Problem linking, auto-routing | Core ITSM, MVP has minimum viable | LOW |
| Epic-02 (Changes) | ✅ CRUD + manual approval | OPA policy-driven approval | Reduce scope, approval via config Phase 2 | LOW |
| Epic-05 (Knowledge) | ✅ All stories | Advanced search, self-healing | MVP enables self-service, Phase 2 optimizes | LOW |
| Epic-06 (Multi-Team) | ❌ Deferred | ✅ All stories | Manual routing MVP, auto-routing Phase 2 | MEDIUM |
| Epic-08 (CMDB) | ❌ Deferred | ✅ All stories | Data heavy, ML required, correctly deferred | MEDIUM |
| Epic-16 (Platform) | ✅ Partial (4/9) | ✅ Remaining 5 | Foundation necessary, ops/advanced features Phase 2 | LOW |

**Verdict:** Phasing logic is sound. MVP has critical path (event system, core ITSM, foundation), Phase 2 builds automation/scale layers.

**Edge Case Found: Epic-16 (Platform)**
- 4 stories completed, 5 remaining
- Remaining 5 stories are operational (CI/CD, migrations, observability ops, runbooks, alert routing)
- **Recommendation:** Clarify whether these 5 stories block MVP or are Phase 1 polish
- **Status:** Not critical - deployment can proceed with basic observability

## Part 4: Technical Feasibility Assessment

### Major Technical Risks - Identified & Planned ✅

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation | Owner | Timeline |
|------|----------|-----------|-------|----------|
| Event-driven architecture complexity | HIGH | Spring Modulith validates pattern, community proven | Dev team | Week 1-2 spike |
| OPA policy correctness | MEDIUM | Shadow mode testing, decision receipts enable validation | Security team | Phase 2 Epic-5 |
| SLA timer precision (±5s window) | MEDIUM | Flowable proven, testing covers edge cases | Dev team | Week 6-7 |
| Cross-module eventual consistency | MEDIUM | Freshness badges make lag visible, projection lag <200ms p95 | Dev team | Week 8-9 |
| Kubernetes multi-zone failover | MEDIUM | CloudNative-PG HA proven, chaos testing planned Phase 2 | DevOps | Phase 2 Epic-13 |
| Multi-tenant data isolation (future) | HIGH | Deferred to Phase 2+, current model is single-tenant self-hosted | Architecture | Future |

**Verdict:** All major technical risks are known and have mitigation plans.

## Part 5: Dependency Analysis

### Dependency Graph - Validated ✅

```
FOUNDATION (Must be first)
├── Spring Modulith + PostgreSQL ← All other modules depend on this
├── OAuth2 + User Module
└── Event System

CORE ITSM (MVP)
├── Incident Module (depends on: Foundation, Event System, Flowable)
├── Change Module (depends on: Foundation, Event System, OPA)
└── Knowledge Module (depends on: Foundation, Event System)

CROSS-CUTTING (MVP)
├── Audit Pipeline (depends on: Event System)
├── Policy Engine/OPA (depends on: User Module, Audit Pipeline)
└── Observability (depends on: Spring Boot Actuator)

PLATFORM (MVP partial)
├── Kubernetes Deployment (depends on: All above)
├── Envoy Gateway (depends on: Keycloak, OAuth2)
└── GitOps/Flux (depends on: Kubernetes)

PHASE 2 LAYERS
├── Multi-Team Routing (depends on: Core ITSM, OPA, Team Module)
├── CMDB (depends on: Core ITSM, Relationships)
└── Analytics (depends on: Event System, Metrics Pipeline)
```

**Circular Dependencies Found:** ⚠️ 0 (NONE - Clean dependency graph)

**Critical Path:** Foundation → Event System → Core ITSM → Deployment (10 weeks, correct)

**Verdict:** Dependency ordering is correct for 10-week MVP.

## Part 6: Missing Context & Clarifications

### Clarifications Needed (Before Detailed Planning)

**1. Time Tray Persistence (FR-2)**
- **Question:** Are time entries synchronized in real-time or batched?
- **Impact:** Database write volume, caching strategy
- **Recommendation:** Define sync strategy (immediate write vs batch every N seconds)

**2. Incident Assignment Flow (FR-6)**
- **Question:** Can incidents be unassigned (status = "open, no assignee") or must they always have an owner?
- **Impact:** Query logic, SLA timer behavior
- **Recommendation:** Define default behavior (route to queue vs require assignment)

**3. Change Calendar Conflicts (FR-8)**
- **Question:** Can conflicting changes be scheduled on same date/time, or blocked at creation?
- **Impact:** UX design for conflict resolution
- **Recommendation:** Define "conflict" semantics (same service? overlapping maintenance windows?)

**4. Knowledge Article Expiry (FR-11)**
- **Question:** What happens to expired articles? Hidden? Archived? Deleted?
- **Impact:** Data retention, search behavior
- **Recommendation:** Define lifecycle states for articles

**Before starting development:**

1. **Define Routing Algorithm** (4 hours)
   - Skill scoring formula
   - Capacity measurement method
   - Escalation trigger logic
   - Owner: Architecture + Product

2. **Define Freshness Thresholds** (2 hours)
   - UX impact per data type
   - System behavior at >10 second lag
   - Read-only vs normal display
   - Owner: UX + Frontend

3. **Clarify Time Tray Sync** (1 hour)
   - Real-time vs batched writes
   - Database impact analysis
   - Owner: Dev team + DBA

### Phase 2: Address Clarifications (Before Epic Sprints)

Each of the 4 clarifications above should be resolved before the corresponding epic sprint begins:
- Time Tray clarification → Before Epic-00 sprint
- Incident assignment → Before Epic-01 sprint
- Change conflicts → Before Epic-02 sprint
- Knowledge expiry → Before Epic-05 sprint

### Phase 3: Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation | Timeline |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Event system complexity | Architecture spike + proof of concept | Week 1 |
| OPA policy governance | Define policy review process | Week 2 |
| SLA timer precision | Edge case testing in dev environment | Week 7 |
| Cross-module consistency | Integration testing with event lag simulation | Week 9 |
