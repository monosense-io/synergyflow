## 12. Enhanced Performance & Reliability Requirements

### 12.1 Performance SLAs (Updated for Enterprise Reliability)

**Response Time Targets**:

- Page load: <1.5 seconds initial (improved), <300ms subsequent (improved)
- API responses: <200ms for CRUD operations (improved for enterprise)
- Search results: <800ms for full-text search (improved)
- Report generation: <20 seconds for standard reports (improved)
- File upload: Support up to 100MB with progress indicators
- **Cross-Module Communication**: <50ms event publication latency (improved)
- **Database Failover**: <30 seconds automated recovery (new)

**Throughput Requirements (Enhanced for Enterprise Scale)**:

- Concurrent users: 1000 initial (doubled), scalable to 10,000+ (doubled)
- Ticket volume: 25,000 tickets/day peak processing (2.5x increase)
- API requests: 200,000 requests/hour sustained (doubled)
- Database transactions: 2000+ TPS with partitioned event publication registry (on-prem HA)
- Event processing: <50ms event publication latency, <500ms cross-module propagation
- **High Availability**: 99.5% uptime during business hours (43.8 hours max downtime/year)

**Reliability Targets (New)**:

- **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)**: <15 minutes for critical failures
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: <5 minutes maximum data loss
- **Cache Hit Ratio**: >95% for frequently accessed data (improved)
- **Database Query Performance**: <50ms for 99% of queries (improved)

### 12.2 Enterprise Scalability Design (Enhanced)

**Internal Scale Horizontal Scaling**:

- Stateless application design across 3+ nodes/racks within a single data center
- Session storage in Redis (persistent, not in-memory)
- Database primary with 2+ read replicas across racks (sync standby where feasible)
- CDN for static assets and file downloads with global distribution
- Event publication registry partitioning with automated cleanup
- **Load Balancing**: Application Load Balancer with health checks
- **Auto-Scaling**: Automatic scaling based on CPU, memory, and event volume

**Reliability Enhancements**:

- **Circuit Breakers**: Failure isolation for external dependencies
- **Bulkhead Pattern**: Resource isolation between critical and non-critical operations
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with jitter for transient failures
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continued operation with reduced functionality during outages

**Multi-Layer Caching Strategy**:

- **Application-level**: Service catalog, user profiles, team assignments (Redis)
- **Database-level**: Frequently accessed queries, dashboard data with intelligent cache warming
- **HTTP-level**: Static resources, API responses with geo-distributed CDN
- **Module-level**: Cross-module query results with event-driven cache invalidation
- **Session-level**: Persistent sessions in Redis
