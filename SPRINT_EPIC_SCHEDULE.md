# 🚀 SynergyFlow 12-Month Sprint Plan (24 Sprints)

> This schedule sequences delivery across all PRD epics with explicit parallel work opportunities. It assumes a **5-person team** (3 backend, 1 frontend, 1 DevOps/SRE) and **2-week sprints**. Adjust dates by setting Sprint 01 start in your tracker; the plan is relative (Sprint 01 → Sprint 24).

## 📋 Core Assumptions

| Assumption | Details |
|------------|---------|
| **Cadence** | 24 sprints, 2 weeks each (≈12 months total) |
| **Definition of Done** | All acceptance criteria met, regression passes, docs updated, dashboards reflect KPIs |
| **Environments** | dev → stg → prod with promotion gates |
| **References** | PRD epics (docs/prd/epics.md), Architecture Next Steps (docs/architecture/17-summary-next-steps.md), Contracts (docs/contracts) |

## 🔗 Cross‑Epic Dependencies

| Epic | Dependencies | Description |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| **Epic‑16** (Platform) | **Foundation First** | Enables data, events, deploy, and observability for all other epics |
| **Epic‑00** (Trust + UX) | Platform | Depends on Platform (events, DB, OPA) and unlocks trust UX patterns used everywhere |
| **Epic‑01** (Incidents) | Platform + Trust | Depends on Platform + Trust pack for incident workflows |
| **Epic‑02** (Changes) | Platform + OPA + Flowable | Depends on Platform + OPA + Flowable for change management |
| **Epic‑03/04** (Self‑Service/Catalog) | Epic‑01 APIs | Can run in parallel once Epic‑01 APIs exist |
| **Epic‑06** (Multi‑Team Routing) | Incident/Change workflows | Builds on incident/change workflows and trust signals |
| **Epic‑07/08** (ITAM/CMDB) | Data foundations | Feed Dashboards/BI (Epics 09/10) |
| **Epic‑11** (Notifications) | Event system | Rides the event system infrastructure |
| **Epic‑12‑15** (Optimization) | All previous | Harden and integrate everything |

## ⚡ Parallelization Guidance

| Strategy | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **DevOps/SRE Capacity** | Always reserve capacity each sprint for GitOps, observability, and security baselining |
| **Frontend/Backend Parallel** | Run frontend-heavy work in parallel with backend-heavy work when dependencies allow |
| **Contract-First Approach** | Keep contract-first (OpenAPI/AsyncAPI) to enable parallel stubbed development |

## 🏊 Parallel Lanes Model

We plan and execute each sprint across **four swimlanes** to maximize safe parallelism while respecting dependencies.

| Lane | Role | Focus Areas |
|------|------|-------------|
| **🔧 Backend (BE)** | Spring Boot/Modulith | Domain, events, persistence |
| **🎨 Frontend (FE)** | Next.js App Router | UI, hooks, accessibility |
| **🚀 DevOps/SRE (OPS)** | Infrastructure | GitOps, environments, observability, security |
| **🧪 QA/Automation (QA)** | Quality Assurance | Contract tests, integration/E2E, quality gates |

### Lane Rules
- **WIP Limits**: BE=3, FE=2, OPS=2, QA=2 per sprint; never exceed without PO/SM approval
- **Contract-First**: FE may stub against OpenAPI while BE builds; QA builds contracts in parallel
- **Definition of Ready**: A story enters a lane only if pre-conditions and dependencies are satisfied
- **Evidence**: Each lane produces artifacts (PRs, test reports, dashboards) contributing to sprint Exit criteria
