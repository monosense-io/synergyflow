Status: Draft

# Story
As a CMDB steward,
I want data quality validation and governance policies,
so that relationship accuracy and ownership are maintained.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Define validation rules (required owners, attribute completeness per CIType, relationship constraints) and run periodic checks.
2. Data quality dashboard API exposes scores and violations by type/team; export CSV.
3. Remediation tasks generated for critical violations; notifications sent to owners; audit of closures.
4. Webhooks/events for quality status changes (cmdb.quality.violation.created/resolved).
5. Performance: quality scan batchable with partitioning; metrics exposed.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Validation rules engine and configuration (AC: 1)
- [ ] Scan job and partitioning; metrics (AC: 5)
- [ ] Violations storage and remediation tasks + notifications (AC: 3)
- [ ] Dashboard/report API and export (AC: 2)
- [ ] Events for violations lifecycle (AC: 4)

## Dev Notes
- PRD: 2.9 CMDB (relationship accuracy and governance)
- ADRs: 0006 event partitioning; 0001 event bus
- Architecture: data-architecture.md; observability-reliability.md
- APIs: cmdb.yaml (quality endpoints); system.yaml (notifications)

## Testing
- Rule checks on fixtures; scan performance; notifications and remediation flows
- Dashboard accuracy and export; events lifecycle tests
