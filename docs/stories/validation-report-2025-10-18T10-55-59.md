## Partial Items
- Acceptance criteria list matches story draft exactly (no invention): Evidence: MD vs XML differ only by formatting (backticks around table name)

## Recommendations
1. Must Fix: Ensure docs references count reaches 5+ with specific snippets.
2. Should Improve: Normalize acceptance criteria verbatim (keep backticks).
3. Consider: Add code refs once initial scaffolding lands.
