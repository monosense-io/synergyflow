**Session Date:** 2025-10-17
**Facilitator:** Business Analyst Mary
**Participant:** monosense

## Executive Summary

**Topic:** Unified ITSM + PM Platform with Workflow Automation

**Session Goals:** Explore feature enhancements, implementation strategy, and differentiation opportunities for a comprehensive dual-module platform with FULL feature parity: (1) ITSM Module adopting ALL ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus capabilities, (2) PM Module adopting ALL JIRA features, (3) Unified workflow automation layer solving documented pain points (rigid approvals, poor routing, disconnected systems, complexity overload). Target: 250 concurrent users up to 1,000 total users. Focus areas: feature prioritization/phasing strategy, cross-module integration opportunities, workflow automation scenarios, agent experience optimization, differentiation beyond feature parity, and managing complexity while maintaining usability.
