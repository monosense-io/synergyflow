Status: Draft

# Story
As a platform developer advocate,
I want event publishing standards and language SDKs,
so that services publish versioned, well‑structured events consistently.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Define EventContract registry (name, version, schema, topic, retention) aligned with ADR‑0004; publish/rollback with audit.
2. Provide SDKs (at least one reference language) to publish events with headers (id, type, version, timestamp, correlationId) and schema validation.
3. Topic conventions and partitioning strategy documented (ADR‑0006); default retention and DLQ policies applied.
4. Developer guide and examples for publishing and consuming; codegen for event models from schemas.
5. Conformance tests ensure emitting services validate against schema; CI step verifies event changes per contract policy.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] EventContract registry + CRUD + audit (AC: 1)
- [ ] Publisher SDK with validation and headers (AC: 2)
- [ ] Topic conventions, partitioning, and retention policy (AC: 3)
- [ ] Docs and examples + codegen (AC: 4)
- [ ] Conformance tests + CI integration (AC: 5)

## Dev Notes
- PRD: docs/prd/05-integration-architecture.md (events)
- ADRs: 0004 event contract versioning; 0006 event partitioning
- Architecture: eventing guidance in docs/architecture/eventing-architecture.md
- APIs/Events: events.yaml; system.yaml (contracts)

## Testing
- Registry behaviors; SDK validation; topic conventions; CI enforcement cases
