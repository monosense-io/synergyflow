Status: Draft

# Story
As a software asset manager,
I want a license compliance dashboard,
so that I can monitor usage vs entitlements and act before breaches.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. KPIs per product: seats, usage, remaining, threshold status; filters by product/team/timeframe.
2. Alerts list for approaching/breached thresholds with owners and actions (assign, reclaim, contact).
3. Export CSV/PNG; respects permissions; watermark for sensitive exports.
4. Performance: filter changes update widgets p95 < 1s; caching applied.
5. Accessibility and responsive layout.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] KPI widgets and filters; alerts list (AC: 1, 2)
- [ ] Actions (assign/reclaim/contact) flows (AC: 2)
- [ ] Export and permissions (AC: 3)
- [ ] Caching/performance; a11y/responsive checks (AC: 4, 5)
