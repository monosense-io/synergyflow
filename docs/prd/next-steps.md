# Next Steps

## Immediate Actions (Next 2 Weeks)

**1. Stakeholder Review and Approval**
- [ ] Review PRD with 5-person engineering team (3 backend developers, 1 frontend developer, 1 DevOps/SRE)
- [ ] Review PRD with product stakeholders
- [ ] Incorporate feedback and finalize PRD v1.0
- [ ] Get formal sign-off from product owner (monosense)

**2. Architecture and Technical Design (Critical Path)**
- [x] **Architecture Workflow Completed**
  - System architecture document completed: architecture.md
  - Covers:
    - High-level architecture diagrams (C4 Model: Context, Container, Component)
    - Event-driven integration patterns (Spring Modulith 1.4.2 + Transactional Outbox)
    - Database schema design (Shared PostgreSQL cluster + PgBouncer pooler, 7 schemas, event_publication table)
    - API design patterns (REST, OpenAPI 3.0, Spring Data JPA 3.2.0 data access)
    - Security architecture (OAuth2, OPA 0.68.0 sidecar, audit pipeline)
    - Deployment architecture (Kubernetes, GitOps with Flux CD 2.2.3, HA)
  - **Key Decisions:**
    - **Spring Modulith modular monolith architecture:** 20x faster event processing (50-100ms vs 2-3s with Kafka), eliminates 6 CPU cores, 13.5GB RAM, $250-350/month infrastructure savings, operational simplicity for 5-person team
    - **Shared PostgreSQL cluster pattern:** Consistent with platform (gitlab, harbor, keycloak, mattermost), PgBouncer pooler for connection management, 50% CPU savings, 87% memory savings
    - **Spring Data JPA instead of MyBatis:** Simpler, Spring-native, declarative repository pattern, sufficient for complete product needs, better Spring ecosystem integration

**3. UX/UI Specification (Highly Recommended)**
- [ ] **Initiate UX Specification Workflow**
  - Continue within PM workflow or new session with UX persona
  - Provide inputs: PRD.md, architecture.md (once available)
  - Request: Comprehensive UX/UI specification covering:
    - Information architecture (IA) and navigation structure
    - User flows for 5 primary journeys (from PRD User Journeys section)
    - Component library (based on Shadcn/ui + Tailwind)
    - Screen wireframes for Foundation Phase features
    - Responsive breakpoints and mobile considerations
    - Accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1 AA)
  - Optional: Generate AI Frontend Prompt for rapid prototyping
  - Output: ux-specification.md, ai-frontend-prompt.md
