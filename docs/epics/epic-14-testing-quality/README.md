# Epic 14 — Testing Strategy & Quality Gates

## Epic Goal
Implement a comprehensive test strategy with traceability, risk-based testing, and quality gate enforcement (PRD 11).

## Scope
- In scope: Unit/integration/contract/E2E tests, Given‑When‑Then traceability, CI quality gates, data seeding, non‑functional testing (perf/security), regression.
- Out of scope: Third-party tool audits.

## Key Requirements
- PRD 11: Spring Modulith testing strategy, verification gates, acceptance coverage.

Refs: docs/prd/11-testing-strategy-spring-modulith.md

## Architecture & ADR References
- Testing architecture: docs/architecture/testing-architecture.md
- Event contract versioning: docs/adrs/0004-event-contract-versioning.md
- DB migration policy: docs/adrs/0009-db-migration-schema-evolution.md

## API & Events Impact
- APIs: docs/api/openapi.yaml (contract tests)
- Events: event.contract.tested, regression.suite.passed

## Data Model Impact
- Entities: TestPlan, TraceLink, GateResult.
- Refs: docs/prd/18-data-model-overview.md

## Dependencies
- All domain epics; Epic 12 (Security) for policies; Epic 16 (Deployment & Ops) for CI/CD integration.

## Risks & Mitigation
- Flaky tests → test isolation, deterministic seeds, retries with diagnostics.
- Gate bypass → enforce in CI and server-side pre-merge checks.

## Acceptance Criteria (Epic)
- Traceability from acceptance criteria to automated tests; quality gates block non‑compliant changes; non‑functional checks integrated.

## Story Seeds
1) Test architecture scaffolding and conventions.
2) Contract and event schema tests.
3) Gate evaluation service.
4) Traceability reporting.

## Verification & Done
- CI passes with gates; trace reports cover features; regression green.
