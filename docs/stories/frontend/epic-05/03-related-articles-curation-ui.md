# Story
As a knowledge curator,
I want a related articles curation UI,
so that I can review, pin, or exclude suggestions to improve relevance.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. UI shows machine-generated related article suggestions with confidence; allows pin/exclude per source article.
2. Curations override algorithm results and are versioned with rationale; audit shows who/when/what.
3. Search/filter by article, tags, confidence; bulk pin/exclude actions for authorized users.
4. Preview shows how suggestions will appear in portal and agent UIs.
5. Accessibility and performance standards met.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Suggestions list with confidence and actions; filters (AC: 1, 3)
- [ ] Pin/exclude persistence with versioning and audit (AC: 2)
- [ ] Bulk actions and permissions (AC: 3)
- [ ] Preview panel rendering (AC: 4)
- [ ] a11y/perf checks (AC: 5)
