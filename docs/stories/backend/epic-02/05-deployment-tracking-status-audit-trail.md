Status: Draft

# Story
As a DevOps engineer,
I want deployment tracking across environments with status and auditability,
so that release progress and outcomes are visible and reportable.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Track deployments with environment, status, timestamps, initiator, and related release/change IDs.
2. Emit events deployment.started, deployment.completed (success/failure) with metadata; failures include error summary.
3. Provide APIs to query deployment history and current status; support pagination and filtering (release, env, time range, result).
4. Maintain immutable audit trails for deployment steps and approvals.
5. Surface MTTR and success rate metrics per period for releases.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Deployment model and linkage to releases/changes (AC: 1)
- [ ] Event emissions for deployment lifecycle (AC: 2)
- [ ] Query APIs with pagination/filters (AC: 3)
- [ ] Audit logging of steps/approvals (AC: 4)
- [ ] Metric computation (MTTR/success rate) (AC: 5)

## Dev Notes
- PRD 2.4 Release Management (deployment tracking, KPIs)
- ADRs: 0001 events; 0006 event partitioning for scale; 0009 DB migrations policy
- Architecture: observability-reliability.md for metrics exposure; data-architecture.md for indexing
- APIs: system.yaml (metrics), changes.yaml (deployment links)

## Testing
- Deployment lifecycle event contract tests
- Query/filter correctness with realistic datasets
- Audit immutability tests
- Metric accuracy verification
