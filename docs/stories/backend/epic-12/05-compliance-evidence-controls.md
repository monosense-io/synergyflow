Status: Draft

# Story
As a compliance manager,
I want automated compliance evidence collection and control checks,
so that we can demonstrate adherence to frameworks and detect drifts early.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Define controllable checks mapped to controls (e.g., SOC2, ISO27001) with evidence collectors (config snapshots, policy exports, audit coverage).
2. Evidence store retains artifacts with metadata (control, date, scope, hash) and immutability; links to associated tickets (exceptions/remediations).
3. Scheduled control runs produce pass/fail with rationale and remediation tasks; dashboards expose posture by control domain.
4. Export evidence packages (ZIP/JSON manifest) for audits; PII scrubbing applied; permission‑gated access.
5. Notifications to stakeholders on FAIL; risk acceptance workflow with expiry.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Control and evidence models; mapping to frameworks (AC: 1, 2)
- [ ] Evidence collectors for key controls (authz policy dump, audit retention, encryption settings) (AC: 1)
- [ ] Scheduler and posture computation + tasks (AC: 3)
- [ ] Evidence export with manifest and PII scrubbing (AC: 4)
- [ ] Notifications and risk acceptance workflow (AC: 5)

## Dev Notes
- PRD: docs/prd/13-security-compliance-framework.md (compliance frameworks, evidence)
- Architecture: security-architecture.md; observability-reliability.md
- ADRs: 0009 DB migrations; 0001 event bus; 0011 cache (optional)
- APIs: system.yaml (compliance)

## Testing
- Evidence integrity (hashes); control mapping accuracy
- Scheduler and posture results; export package validation; permissions
