Status: Draft

# Story
As a reliability engineer,
I want SLO definitions and monitoring with alerting hooks,
so that we can measure reliability and act before user impact.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Define SLO model (service, objective type e.g., availability/latency/error rate, target, window, thresholds) and ErrorBudget computation.
2. Ingest metrics from services (availability, latency histograms, error counts) and compute SLI/SLO adherence over rolling windows.
3. Expose SLO status APIs with burn rate, remaining error budget, and breach predictions; emit slo.breach and health.signal events.
4. Integrate alert routes to Notifications (Epic 11) based on multi‑window burn rate policies; configurable per service.
5. Dashboards receive SLO data (via Epic 09) with p95 freshness < 60s; data retention and backfilling supported.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] SLO and ErrorBudget schemas and migrations (AC: 1)
- [ ] Metrics ingestion + SLI calculators (AC: 2)
- [ ] SLO status/burn APIs + events (AC: 3)
- [ ] Alert policy engine and Notification hooks (AC: 4)
- [ ] Export to dashboard tiles and retention/backfill jobs (AC: 5)

## Dev Notes
- PRD: docs/prd/09-high-availability-reliability-architecture.md; docs/prd/12-enhanced-performance-reliability-requirements.md
- Architecture: docs/architecture/observability-reliability.md
- ADRs: 0011 cache (for tiles), 0006 event partitioning (metrics streams), 0001 event bus
- APIs/Events: system.yaml (SLO endpoints), events (slo.breach, health.signal)

## Testing
- SLO math on fixtures; burn rate alert policies; event emission
- API correctness and performance; dashboard freshness checks
