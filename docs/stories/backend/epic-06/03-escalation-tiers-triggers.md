# Story
As a support operations lead,
I want escalation tiers and triggers,
so that tickets are escalated appropriately to protect SLAs and customer outcomes.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Define escalation tiers (L1→L2→L3) with rules based on elapsed time vs SLA thresholds, severity upgrades, or explicit customer escalation.
2. Triggers reassign or notify the next tier; emit ticket.escalated event with context (reason, from→to tier, SLA remaining).
3. Manual escalation supported with rationale; audit trail recorded.
4. Suppress oscillations with hysteresis/backoff; prevent ping‑pong between teams.
5. Configuration per service/team; safe defaults provided; changes auditable.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Escalation policy model and configuration endpoints (AC: 5)
- [ ] Trigger engine evaluating rules and generating actions (AC: 1, 2)
- [ ] Manual escalation endpoint with RBAC and audit (AC: 3)
- [ ] Hysteresis/backoff safeguards (AC: 4)
- [ ] Event emissions and notification hooks (AC: 2)

## Dev Notes
- PRD: docs/prd/04-multi-team-support-intelligent-routing.md (escalation rules)
- ADRs: 0001 event bus; 0006 partitioning; 0004 versioning
- Architecture: observability-reliability.md (alerting integration)
- APIs: teams.yaml, incidents.yaml, events.yaml; notifications via system.yaml

## Testing
- Rule evaluation scenarios and edge cases; manual escalation with audit
- Hysteresis/backoff behavior; event contract tests
