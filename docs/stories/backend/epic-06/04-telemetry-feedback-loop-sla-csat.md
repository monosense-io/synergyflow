Status: Draft

# Story
As a quality engineer,
I want a telemetry feedback loop that feeds SLA/CSAT outcomes into routing,
so that routing decisions continuously improve and reduce MTTR.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Ingest SLA outcomes (breach/warn/attained) and CSAT ratings per team/agent; aggregate over rolling windows.
2. Compute performance scores that adjust routing weights (e.g., SLA performance term) with caps to avoid volatility.
3. Expose metrics and current weight adjustments via API; changes logged with rationale (formula and inputs).
4. A/B testing toggles allow comparing weight strategies; results recorded for analysis.
5. Privacy and compliance: CSAT data anonymized/aggregated per policy; access controlled.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Telemetry ingestion services and data aggregation (AC: 1)
- [ ] Weight adjustment engine with caps and decay (AC: 2)
- [ ] Metrics/inspection APIs and audit logging (AC: 3)
- [ ] A/B toggle framework and result capture (AC: 4)
- [ ] Security controls for CSAT and telemetry data (AC: 5)

## Dev Notes
- PRD: docs/prd/04-multi-team-support-intelligent-routing.md (SLA optimization; team performance)
- ADRs: 0001 event bus; 0006 partitioning; 0011 cache (optional)
- Architecture: data-architecture.md (aggregations); observability-reliability.md (metrics expos.)
- APIs: system.yaml (metrics), teams.yaml

## Testing
- Aggregation correctness; weight adjustments; cap/decay behavior
- A/B toggling flows; metrics visibility
- Security tests for CSAT access controls
